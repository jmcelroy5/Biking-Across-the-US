            <h3> The Gear List</h3>
            <p> Preparing for a long bike tour turned me into a gear head. On more nights than I can count I stayed up way too late reading bike touring blogs and perusing backpacking forums to learn about the finer specifications of bikes, panniers, camping stoves, tents, sleeping pads, sleeping bags, water carrying systems, leathermans, you name it. I knew I had a problem when I found myself pages deep in Amazon reviews for a travel towel.
            <p> One of the draws of bike touring for me is the freedom and self-sufficiency of having basically everything you need to live - food, clothes, shelter - all on your bike. Having to pare down your posessions to fit in four saddlebags makes you think about clothes and gear in terms of its performance and versatility. Sometimes the planning feels like half the fun. It reminds me a bit of when I would fantasize about running away from home as a kid. Not that I ever had a reason to run away, I think I just enjoyed planning which toys I would take with me in my backpack.
            <p> Without further ado, this is my semi-final gear list. I posted this picture on the bicycle touring subreddit to get some advice, and I also did a trial 2-night bike trip last weekend to test out my whole bike touring setup. So, after all the lessons learned, I have several major changes to make and will post another picture when I am packing up for real.</p>
