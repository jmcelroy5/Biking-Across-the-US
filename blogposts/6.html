            <p> <h4>Journal entry from day 2 of the mini bike trip:</h4>
            <p>WOW, what an intense and fantastic day! Probably more intense than I anticipated, but there were so many beautiful, wonderful moments. I got a leisurely start this morning at China Camp. I putzed around making breakfast and packing up my wet tent while trail runners and mountain bikers whizzed by the trail right next to my campsite. 
            <p>Instead of heading straight out, I decided to ride a loop through the park along the coast, making a stop at China Camp Village, a collection of shrimp fishing buildings preserved as a historic site. Rolling out of the park onto the main road I felt at once peaceful and overwhelmingly joyful. I had to refrain from yelling "GOOD MORNING!" to every park visitor I saw coming in, as if I were the self-appointed state park service greeter. 
            <p> Once I got to San Rafael, I spent a few hours at a Peets enjoying a latte while I charged my phone and responded to emails. Back on the road, I took Sir Francis Drake to cut across Marin County toward Point Reyes. There were two major mountain climbs for the day. On one I simply ran out of fuel and decided to take a snack break at a turnout. I sat and ate a clif bar on the side of the road and cheered on the other cyclists on their way up.</p>
            <p>I took one detour, which may have added nearly 10 miles to my route but was so, so worth it. It was a quiet country road hugged on both sides by green hills and grazing horses. Another ride highlight was going through Samuel P. Taylor Park. Seeing the sun streaming through the redwoods onto the winding road was breathtaking. That park has a hike/bike site that I've made a mental note to check out one day.
            <p> I reached Point Reyes National Seashore, where I had a campsite reservation for the night. I had plenty of daylight remaining, but little did I know that the hardest climb of the day still lay ahead of me, 800 feet of elevation gain over 3 miles. I guess that's what I get for choosing the campsite called "Sky Campground." 
            <p> When I reached the trailhead I walked my bike for another mile up a steep, muddy trail. I talked to two ladies hiking by. I have to admit I was proud when they asked where I'd come from. "That's a long way! Are you all alone?" and "Good for you!" they said. Later on a fox scampered across my path just a few feet ahead of me. 
            <p>I made it to camp and realized I didn't know which of the 12 sites I had reserved online weeks before, and I had no cell service to check the email confirmation. Seeing that there were only a few other groups there, I chose a campsite in a mossy, shady grove at the very back and just hoped no one else came to claim it. 
            <p> Now I'm sitting here on a picnic table bundled up in all my layers (I can tell it's going to be a cold night.) The sun is getting lower, and I'm listening to the sound of hawks flying overhead and a young couple nearby who have been playing the guitar and singing since I arrived. Other than that it's incredibly quiet and remote up here. I can only faintly hear the ocean below us. 
            <p>I found it a little unnerving at first to be out here alone with 0 cell service, but then I reminded myself there's actually nothing to worry about. People used to live in a more quiet world, and their minds were probably more quiet, too. They weren't always connected to a steady stream of information. Other people didn't always know where they were. They could be alone and uncontactable.
            <p>I'm glad I got to experience these two whole days of planning, navigating, and riding, and I'm glad I did it alone. If someone else had come with me I would have had to worry that I was going too fast or slow for them and fretted non-stop about their enjoyment. Riding alone is great, because you decide the pace, and you're free to stop whenever you want. 
            <p>This little weekend trip has been liberating and exhilerating and affirming of this cross-country trip I'm about to make. I can do it. I can bike across the country. And it'll be fun! I am going to get to know myself again and be my own best companion. And when I get lonely I'll have the other TransAm cyclists to talk to.
