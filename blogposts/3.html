            <h3><a style="rgb(32,89,150)">A Beautiful Machine</a></h3>
            <p style="color:grey;"> Monday, April 7, 2014</p>
                <p> Growing up in the sprawling suburbs of Houston, I hated the fact that there was no choice but to drive everywhere and spend time every day sitting in traffic. I hated ugly 18-lane spaghetti freeways and expansive Costco parking lots. I hated the fact that there were few safe places for me to play as a kid and that whenever I wanted to go somewhere my parents had to drive me.
                <p>In college I was introducted to Houston's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Mass_(cycling)">Critical Mass</a> bike rides and quickly became fired up about the idea of biking as a form of transportation. To me bicycles came to represent freedom from the trappings and social isolation of car-dependency.<p> I finally had the chance to align my lifestyle with this ideal when I moved to Berkeley and found myself in a city that's dense and well-designed enough for biking to actually be a sensible transportation option. Now I have a more nuanced appreciation for the ease and flexibility and other benefits of biking. My bike commute to work gets me energized for the day, and on the way home I can stop at the store, where I bypass the parking lot and lock my bike right next to the door, and then cruise home with my panniers full of groceries.
                <p> I love the humane speed of bicycling. I love that there's nothing between you and your surroundings, the air, the sounds, and the smells. Bicycles are clean, quiet, efficient, elegant, simple, and sustainable. I'm an unapologetic evangelist for this humble machine's potential to reshape our daily lives and our cities for the better. And now it seems like an exciting and natural extension to use it a vehicle for long-distance travel.</p>
