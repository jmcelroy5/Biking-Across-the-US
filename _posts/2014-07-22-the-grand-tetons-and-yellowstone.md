####Jenny Lake to Jackson, WY (20 mi)

My cousin, Courtney, was flying up from Denver to meet me in Jackson Hole, just 30 miles off the TransAm route right outside the entrance to Grand Teton National Park. She had a ski buddy there who had offered to let us stay at his house, even though he was out of town that week. She had never been to the Grand Tetons or Yellowstone before, and she planned to rent a car for a few days so we could get around the parks.

Waking up at Jenny Lake, I was surprised to see the tip of a mountain poking out from the clouds. When I had arrived the day before it was so overcast, I hadn't even seen the giant that hovered over our campsite. The weather was supposed to clear up beautifully over the next few days, perfect timing for Courtney's visit.

From Jenny Lake it was just a 20 mile ride along bike paths to Jackson Hole, and I had plenty of time before Courtney's flight arrived in the late afternoon. I spent the morning making breakfast and eventually second breakfast as conversation with the other hiker/bikers stretched on through the morning.

Finally I got on the road for the easy ride, stopping halfway at a grocery store for lunch. I sat at a picnic table outside and called my good friend, Fiona, who had just gotten back to the Bay from an incredible trip to India. When I continued to Jackson Hole it was raining and a headwind slowed down my progress, but it was easy to endure knowing I only had 10 miles to go before I could take several days off from biking.

Jackson Hole is a charming, historic Wild West town. Arches made of antlers marked the entrances to the town square, and all the sidewalks were made of wood. I walked around for a while, moseying into overpriced outdoor stores and boutiques, and then settled down at the Cowboy Cafe to wait for Courtney. When she arrived we caught up over drinks at the Million Dollar Cowboy Bar where a taxodermied bear (killed by a man with his bear hands) was on display and instead of bar stools patrons sat straddling real leather horse saddles.

We met Courtney's friend's roommate for dinner then headed to his house. It was a beautiful place with two guest rooms and a hot tub on the back patio that we didn't hesitate to jump in when we arrived. Jackson Hole has a growing reputation as an enclave for the rich, so this guy must be doing pretty well to own such a nice place there. 

####Touring Yellowstone the Easy Way

We woke up early and went to the local diner for a hearty breakfast. We loved it so much we became regulars for the rest of our stay in Jackson.

We decided to make the most of our day there and drive the entire main loop of the park, which goes by several geyser basins in the western part of the park, stretches all the way to Mammoth Hot Springs just south of Montana, and then back down through the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone.

The whole loop took nearly 12 hours to drive, and the weekend traffic made it feel like riding along the conveyor belt of a Disneyland ride. But the incredible variety of geothermal features and stunning vistas we got to see made braving the crowds well worth it. The day felt like one long feast for the eyes.

We even had several intimate wildlife sightings from the relative safety of the car:

####Hiking in the Tetons

The next day after breakfast at our favorite spot, Courtney and I took a ferry across Jenny Lake and did a short hike up to an incredible view at Inspiration Point.

Back in Jackson Hole, Courtney made a friend at a happy hour and followed his recommendation to the best steakhouses town. After dinner we went to an old western style saloon and theatre where they were putting on a musical called Paint Your Wagon. The talent was impressive, the songs were catchy, and the storyline was enthralling. It was nice to have an infusion of culture this trip!

#### Back on the Trail

Once again it came time to say goodbye to Courtney who was on her way to Puerto Rico for part two of her vacation. She dropped me and my bike off where I had departed from the TransAm, and I proceeded to ride much of the same route we had driven the day before when we went to Yellowstone. In the car the terrain had appeared pretty flat, but on the bike I realized that the first thirty or forty miles are a constant uphill. I stopped at a geyser basin we didn't get to see the day before.

That night I stayed at an enormous campground on the western edge of the park full of hundreds of RVs. A ranger with a British accent seemed thrilled to have a non-vehicle camper, and he graciously showed me to the hiker/biker area, which I'd have all to myself that night. He said to knock on the office door for coffee in the morning.

After eating my dinner I stored all my food and odorous items in the bear box and crashed early, excited to cross the Montana state line just 11 miles away the next morning.
