Before taking off on a four month solo bike trip I figure it's probably a good idea to know what you're getting yourself into. Before this year I could count the number of nights I'd spent in a tent on two hands, and I had definitely never gone camping alone. While I'm used to biking around town, I'd never done any longer tours or highway riding by myself. So, I decided to plan a two-night bike trip to test out my gear and get a little taste of bike touring close to home before I set off on the big trip.  

A few Saturdays ago I set off at 4:30 PM in a cold drizzle from San Francisco, riding my fully-loaded bike, headed for China Camp State Park in Marin 30 miles away. I was cursing myself for going to an HTML workshop that morning instead of getting an earlier start on the ride. After the workshop I had burned another couple hours of daylight waffling over the decision to go or wait for the next day. When I finally set off, it was hard to ward off the doubts in my head. I half expected to think better of it and turn back at some point.    

I got lost in the Presidio before I even made it out of the city. I asked a lady who was out walking her dogs for directions. She took a look at my loaded bike and asked where I was going in this weather. Her eyes bugged out when I told her my destination. At that point I still hadn't fully committed to the ride in my head, and I nearly crumpled under this stranger's scrutiny.     
    
I made it to Sausalito and half contemplated taking a ferry back from there, but I willed myself to keep going just a little further, knowing I'd be on the Mill Valley-Sausalito bike path soon. I continued following Google's bike directions and was pleasantly surprised to find at each turn that I was mostly routed along car-free multi-use pathways and well-designated bike routes. If only the rest of the US were as bike-friendly as Marin!     
    
I felt triumphant when the road signs for China Camp State Park appeared and it hit me that I was going to make it there. I rolled up to the campsite and signed my name on a board for a hiker/biker site. The site was just $5, rather than $30 for for a car camping site. I set up my tent and fired up my little camping stove, just as the last of the sunlight faded away.    
    
In the light of my headlamp I found a massive can of pozole soup in the critter box, left there by a previous camper, which I traded out for the mac and cheese I had brought with me. I had just enough time to heat the soup and gulp it down before I started feeling raindrops. I quickly cleaned up then tumbled into my sleeping bag where I slept soundly and contentedly to the sound of rain pattering on the tent.  

I'm sure a couple months from now when I'm a seasoned bike traveler I'll look back and laugh about how anxious I got about my first little overnight trip. I hope I don't forget, though, that the first step of a long journey often feels frightening and unnatural. That doesn't mean it's wrong, though; It's just a sign that you're stretching your comfort zone.
