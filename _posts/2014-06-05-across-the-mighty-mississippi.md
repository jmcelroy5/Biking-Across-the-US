####Chester, IL to Farmington, MO (50 mi)

After our night in Chester, we went to the Hardee's in town for a hearty breakfast, where we unexpectedly found ourselves in the thick of Chester's social scene. It seemed like every old man in town was at the Hardee's that morning, and they were all chatting it up with each other. They recognized us as cyclists and pulled us into the conversation.

It's nice that locals have been so friendly to us, but sometimes I get a little weary of repeating the same conversation! Where you from? Where'd you start? Where are you going? How long's that gonna take you? Then, they give you their advice on which route you should take to the next town, warning that the road you were planning to take is too steep or narrow or dangerous, which you politely thank them for but immediately dismiss in your head, having learned that directions from non-cyclists, though well-intentioned, are rarely useful. Then they wish you a good trip and tell you to "Be safe!" or "Look out for trucks!" You thank them but feel mildly puzzled what that even means. You just hope those trucks are looking out for you!

When we finally extricated ourselves from social hour, the next thing to do was cross the Mississippi River into Missouri, our fourth state! Right after we took the requisite picture of the "welcome to Missouri" sign, we noticed two touring bikes parked outside of a gas station. We went over to find the owners, and we met Mike and Bill from Chicago.

Mike (on the recumbent) is doing the whole TransAmerica from east to west, and Bill is his pastor who had joined him for a week of riding. Mike had apparently been hearing about me since he started! Every so often a shopkeeper would tell him there was a girl a few days ahead of him. He said one lady at a store in Virginia seemed scandalized that I was traveling solo.

Mike and Bill had gotten started at 5:30 that morning and had already ridden 50 miles, and all we had done was cross a bridge! They had 20 miles to go, so we rode on with them until they got to their motel. Tuan and I continued on, despite a major road closure on the route. Bike privilege!

We made it to Farmington, a cute and wonderfully bike-friendly town, where we were planning to stay at Al's Place Bike Hostel. Al's Place is in an old county jailhouse that was converted to a hostel specifically for TransAmerican cyclists. We had been hearing great things about it, and it lived up to the hype!Our friend, Lewis, had arrived there before us, and there were also two new cyclists, Bruce and Bill, two recent retirees from San Jose. They were biking from Colorado to DC, supported by a van driven by Bruce's dad.

####Farmington, MO to Ellington, MO (63 mi)

Farmington turned out to be an excellent crossroads for bike tourers. Since our new friends Mike and Bill were only a half day's ride behind us and started their rides really early in the morning, they would be passing through town right around the time Tuan and I normally just getting moving for the day. We coordinated with them to meet for breakfast at Bauhaus Kaffee. I had an energy-packed breakfast of sausage, egg, and cheese on a bagel with a side of porridge and three HUGE cups of coffee that would power me all day.

During breakfast two other cyclists came in, a daughter and dad team who were doing a tour of 40 Missouri state parks. Mike had been following their blog, so he was excited to meet them in person. They are traveling with a stuffed rooster that they named "You," because so many of their friends said they wished they could join them on the trip. Now "You" are going on the trip, and I wish "You" would pedal! They are blogging [here](http://www.crazyguyonabike.com/doc/40stateparks).

The daugher, Rachel, said after the trip she's going back to school for a masters in transportation policy and hopes to work for the Missouri DOT on bike planning. She said that Missouri had recently put up the Route 76 bicycle signs at all the turns on the TransAmerica route, which we had thoroughly been enjoying. Virginia and Missouri are the only states with the signs so far, but it'll be so cool when the rest of them get on board. Then, at least in theory, cyclists could follow the route all the way across the country, even without maps!

After breakfast we made a trip to the town's bike shop, TransAmerican Cyclery, to make a few adjustments on our bikes. Then Tuan and i set off with Mike and Bill for their second half (and our first half) of the day's ride. And a glorious ride it was! That day stands out as one of the best of the entire trip.

After the grey dullness of Illinois, riding through Missouri made it seem like someone had just turned the color back on. I couldn't stop marveling at the bright blue sky, the soft-looking grass, and the lush greenness of the Ozarks. The weather was great, and we felt full of energy. It also helped that there was an epic downhill section that went on for probably 10 miles. It was better than any roller coaster I've ever been on.

Mike and Bill stopped at a state park, and Tuan and I went on another 30 miles to a small town called Ellington. We were excited to find a grocery store where we could get bread and fresh produce for our dinner (non gas station / dollar store food is hard to come by these days!). We met yet another cyclist there! His name was Bill, and he's touring from Florida to Oregon on the TransAm then up to Canada. He warned us that the next day from Ellington was one of the hardest on the entire trail in terms of elevation change.

Loaded down with groceries, we made our way to the town park to set up camp. They had a pavilion-type shelter with picnic tables, so I didn't even bother to pitch my tent. The town park was abuzz with activity all evening. We watched a little league baseball game and then joined in on some exercises with a group of middle-aged ladies and their bootcamp coach. 

As it got dark people started filtering out of the park and we got out the camp stove to heat up soup and rolls for dinner. It started raining, and we were so glad to be under the shelter. I expected a pleasant night with the sound of pattering rain on the roof, but it turned out to be the roughest night yet. At about midnight I was jolted from a deep slumber and opened my eyes to the sight of truck headlights mere feet away and seeming to come right at me. In my groggy confusion, I jumped up from my sleeping bag with my heart pounding wildly, thinking I was about to get run over.

It turned out to be some local kid doing donuts over and over in the parking lot, probably trying to impress his friends. After he finally peeled out, I couldn't fall back asleep. Then I started to hear rustling sounds in the woods next to us that sounded like footsteps. After what seemed like an hour of lying there with eyes wide open, listening alertly, a pack of six dogs quietly emerged from the trees. Having heard about mean wild dog packs back in Kentucky, I laid stock still and hoped they didn't notice me. They walked right through the pavilion then continued on their way. At least after that it was easier to dismiss the rustling sounds in the woods, and I managed to fall asleep for a few hours before the sun came up. 

####Ellington, MO to Summersville, MO (50 mi)

Up to that point the Ozarks had seemed like rolling hills compared to the endless climbs and treacherous descents in the Appalachians. But the elevation chart showed that the hills would become much steeper and spikier for the 30 miles after Ellington. That section is the cause of much dread and complaint among TransAm cyclists, but it really wasn't as bad as everyone said. There are some long, steep climbs, but at least you can almost always see the top of the hill. I find that that makes a huge difference psychologically to see the end in sight. Sometimes you could even get a "freebie" when the momentum of one hill gets you over the hump of the next one with little to no pedaling!

It was overcast and cool all morning, good weather for climbing. I only needed half a bottle of water the whole way. We made it to Eminence, the town at the end of the 30 miles, and found a family diner. As we were about to go in, we spotted Mike and Bill outside of a B&B across the street. We had lost touch with them because I hadn't been getting cell service, so we had missed them when they passed through Ellington that morning. They joined us for lunch, and we scarfed down amazing bacon cheeseburgers and fries to celebrate getting past the worst of the Ozarks.

Mike and Bill had even written a song and made a hilarious [video](http://www.crazyguyonabike.com/doc/page/?o=1&page_id=371488&v=37) about the "12 hills of Oh! Zarks!".

Leaving Eminence, my bike chain came off. I fixed it quickly then set off to ride again. When I downshifted for the first hill out of town, I heard an AWFUL noise, and my pedals seized up. I was horrified to see that my rear derailleur was bent out of shape and caught in my spokes. Very luckily, we hadn't gotten far at all, so I got back in a high gear and coasted back into town to find Bill and Mike. 

Bill knows a lot about bikes, and he was able to work some magic to make mine rideable again. My leatherman's pliers weren't strong enough to bend the derailleur back, but very fortunately Bill had a pair of miniature vice grips, which did the trick. He said he almost didn't pack them, but decided to throw them in at the last minute to be overly cautious. So glad he did!

When we set off again, my bike was shifting like a champ. We stopped at a beautiful Ozark spring for a refreshing dip in the crystal clear water. Then we had a ridiculously steep hill to tackle. The worst hills always come right after a river.

That hill marked the end of the worst of the Ozarks. The terrain flattened out into pleasantly rolling hills. We made it to a town called Summersville that night. We've gotten into a routine when we arrive in a town: shop for fresh food from the grocery store, ask where the town park is, set up camp, and fire up the stove for dinner.

Even though we were in the center of town, that night was much more peaceful than the one before. I slept like a rock.

####Summersville, MO to Hartville, MO (60 mi)

The next day was a great ride along much easier terrain. I was in high spirits, still enjoying the stunning scenery. I really think Missouri is my favorite state so far, which is crazy, because I really had low expectations for it. I had no idea how beautiful it would be! Our destination that day was Hartville, a charming town where we could camp on the courthouse lawn.

Meanwhile, my parents were driving up from Houston to meet me on the trail for the weekend. My dad had just bought a new bike and wanted to ride with me for a few days. That night they stayed in a hotel in Marshfield, just 25 miles due west, and then drove to Hartville to meet us for breakfast in the morning.
