####Leoti, KS to Sheridan Lake, CO (51 miles)

On our last day in Kansas, Tuan and I stopped in a small town and saw saw five bikes we recognized outside of a gas station. We met up with our friends, and then we all headed to over a gastropub across the street for lunch. Wait, what? A gastropub in Kansas? That's when we knew we had reached the transition zone into Colorado.

After a decadent meal and two beers each, a nap sounded much better than getting back on our bikes for another 30 miles. But we knew the state line lay just ahead, and we were eager to cross it. We whooped and hollered when this came into view:

... shortly followed by the most epic state welcome sign we've seen yet!

From there it was a short jaunt down a beautifully paved road to Sheridan Lake, where we were going to stay at a church with all the other cyclists. When we were just a few miles away, we noticed that the sky up ahead looked very dark and threatening. Luckily we got into town just before the storm broke loose. 

We stopped briefly to talk to Paul outside the Sheridan Lake gas station and saw his riding partner, Terry, perched on a post at the far side of the gas station staring out into the distance. There was a tornado warning in the area, and he wanted to see it.

At the church we were greeted by the pastor, his wife, and their two kids. It was going to be a full house that night. The five guys, Esther and Warren from the night before, a father and son biking East, and a solo Eastbounder from Oregon were all staying there, too. It was the biggest group the church had ever hosted.

Shortly after we arrived we all crowded on the porch to watch the bizarre weather unfold. The wind created a massive dust storm and sent tumbleweeds hurtling by. The pastor's wife pointed out a green tint in the clouds that indicated hail was coming and a patch of circling clouds that looked like the beginning of a tornado. Fortunately it never fully developed, though I'm sure Terry was disappointed. We found out later that a tornado had touched down on a farm just 3 miles from us.

The pastor's sweet 10-year-old daughter had taken an immediate liking to me as the only solo female cyclist in the group. The storm was scaring her, so she tugged me away from the group and took me down to the basement where a group of kids were watching Despicable Me on a projector. I think I enjoyed the movie even more than the kids did!

After the storm passed and all the non-cyclists had left, we spread around the church claiming our spots for the night. I put down my sleeping bag in a Sunday school classroom and swiftly passed out.
