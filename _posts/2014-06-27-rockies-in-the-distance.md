####Ordway to Pueblo (50 miles)

The next morning, determined to salvage something of our dignity, Mike and I snuck into our friends' hotel to use the showers. Then we all went over to a diner next door for breakfast and many cups of coffee. Things were beginning to look brighter already.

Speaking of things looking brighter, over breakfast Paul and Terry (the British guys) made the interesting cultural observation that they find Americans to be an optimistic people. Though we all agreed that in reality upward social mobility is difficult to achieve in our society (because of the high cost of education and other vicious cycles that perpetuate disadvantage), the American cultural narrative champions stories of people arising above their circumstances. Almost everyone believes they will be the one who "makes it." 

Paul and Terry told us about a conversation they had with a local man in his 70s who had just planted a garden of asparagus. Though it takes years for asparagus to mature enough to harvest, and though he may not even live long enough to see the returns from his efforts, he was so enthusiastic about leaving the asparagus behind for his family. Just goes to show that youth is a state of mind, and that it's never too late to start something new. I have been amazed by the number of cyclists in their 60s and 70s I have met on the TransAmerica Trail who possess just as much energy and enthusiasm as I do.

The ride to Pueblo through the Eastern Colorado desert was dry, hot, and quiet. Prairie dogs scurried along the roadside and dove into holes when we came by. Tuan caught up with me that day. He showed up with a new cyclist, a college student who was biking home to California from the East Coast. He had been clocking 100+ mile days, listening to audiobooks along the way. 

Pueblo is one of the largest towns on the route, so of course my first priority was finding the good coffee. Tuan and I found a place that offered a discount for customers arriving on bikes. I had a mocha milkshake with espresso and felt pretty sure Colorado and I were going to be friends.

From the coffee shop we called a number from the TransAm map to someone named Marcella who hosts cyclists in her home. She said she had a full house of family and visitors that night, but we could camp in her yard. I had pictured a middle-aged lady in my head, so I was surprised when the girl who answered the door was not much older than me.

Marcella took us to the grocery store to get beer and things for dinner. Tuan and I chopped up a ton of vegetables, Marcella supplied the chicken, and we made a delicious stirfry. Tuan also made his signature red cabbage salad. Always a hit!

Marcella had done some bike touring in her early 20s, but after taking advantage of stranger kindness all the time she decided she wanted to be more settled so she could provide for others. At the age of 26 she has assumed a lot of adult responsibility. She lives with her fiancee in a house they recently bought with a vegetable garden and a chicken coop in the back. She is the primary caregiver of his young daughter from a previous relationship, and they have a renter who has two young children also. She has a career in corporate photography, and her fiancee is starting a Master's program in public policy in the fall. Their lives are full and their house somewhat chaotic. It was interesting to get a peek into their reality for a day.

#### Denver (0 miles)

The next day Tuan and I explored Pueblo a little bit and lounged at a coffee shop for a while. Then it came time to say our goodbyes before we went our separate ways. Tuan was going to continue riding, while I stayed with my cousin, Courtney, in Denver for a few days. 

I always enjoy visiting with Courtney, and I was looking forward to some much-needed rest days off the trail. Little did I know I was also in for some serious pampering! On our way to Denver we stopped at a beautiful historic hotel for a fancy /lunch and amazing views. Then we went to a nail salon and got manicures/pedicures and then hopped next door to a hair salon to tame my messy mophead. Then we had a cozy night in watching tv and drinking wine.

The next day we took her dog to the park then went to her gym to relax in the pool and sauna. We went to an amazing barbeque place for dinner then had another cozy movie night. It was the perfect halftime break.

#### Back on the Trail...

Esther and Warren, the bicycle touring veterans I met in Kansas, had expressed concern that taking more than one rest day would make it hard for me to get back on the trail. They said whenever they take a long break they lose a little confidence, and after three days off I definitely experienced a little trepidation before getting back on the bike. When Courtney dropped me where I had left off in Pueblo I had the first day jitters all over again, as if I were setting off on a second, separate bike trip.

But as always, once I got moving I felt great, and soon I was overflowing with excitement for the second half of the TransAmerica. All the places I had looked forward to most still lay ahead of me: the Rockies, the Tetons, Yellowstone, Glacier National Park, Oregon, the Pacific Coast, and finally San Francisco.

####Pueblo to Canon City (50ish miles)

The first part of the first day back on the bike was pretty challenging. The desert was hot and windy, the kind of wind that made even the downhills difficult. I listened to some pump-up music, but I accidentally dropped my earbuds. They got caught in my wheel, and before I could stop the bike the wire had ripped apart. Sigh.

The terrain became increasingly hilly as I entered the foothills of the Rockies, and all day I could see the whole range looming ahead in the distance. I was looking forward to getting out of the desert and up in that cool mountain air.

After about thirty miles I made it to a town with one restaurant that was closed and little else. I was running very low on water and starting to feel dehydrated. Luckily I found a community center, and a friendly man let me in to fill up my water bottles. The following stretch turned me away from the wind. That combined with a downhill made up for a wondrous flying sensation all the way to the next town. 

A race across America from Oregon to Virginia had begun a week or so before, and that day I saw a few of the racers. It's always very clear who the racers are. They have super light packing setups (usually just one dry bag with all their stuff), zombie-like determination in their faces, and no intention to stop and talk. When I see a racer I just give them a salute of respect and feel glad I'm not them. They ride all through the day and night, they're not allowed to receive any support, and there's no reward for winning except bragging rights. No, thank you. I'd rather take my time and really see things along the way.

That evening I set up camp at an RV park outside Canon City then walked to a Wal Mart to get something for dinner. I really believe Wal Mart is the devil incarnate, having read of its unfair treatment of employees and seen firsthand how it it destroys local economic competition, but I was tired enough to set my principles aside for one night. 

I was shocked how stupid cheap everything was there. I got a barbecue chicken wrap, a pint of strawberries, a soft drink, and chips for $5. I stick with my belief that there has to be a better way than letting global corporations hijack our communities, but I also understand the allure of low prices to struggling families. The reality is always so many shades of grey.
