The day's ride flew by with the excitement of finally crossing into the next state and the novelty of conversing with my new riding companions. After hanging out in Glacier for so long then spending three days riding south just to get back on my route, it felt good to be making westward progress again. Two of the guys had resolved to learn Spanish on their bike trip, dedicating precious pannier space to vocab books. Since it's kind of hard to consult a book while riding a bike, I became their Spanish dictionary. 

We went over Lolo pass, a mountain I had been dreading. But the climb wasn't that bad, and before I knew it we were coasting down the mountain into Idaho's Clearwater National Forest where we'd be on a winding road along the Lochsa River for the next several days. Various roadside exhibits informed us we were following the route of the Lewis and Clark expedition when they were shown the best way over the mountain by a Shoshone Native American. I imagine the climb was was a little bit tougher for them!

We started seeing "Moose X-ing" road signs and laughing dismissively. How could they know where a moose would choose to cross the road? We were astonished when the stark silhouette of a massive bull moose came into focus. It was the largest animal I have ever seen. As we approached it clambered up the side of a steep hill with the agility of a linebacker (as one of the guys commented).

We finally reached our campsite for the night, a beautiful and peaceful riverside retreat that only cost $8 for the whole group. We put up our tents then all busied ourselves industriously. I bathed and washed my bike shorts in the freezing river, Ryan started a campfire, Brady read and cooked dinner over the camp stove, and Jeremiah caught a fish that he cooked over the fire.

The next day's route would take us past several trailheads for natural hot springs within the first fifteen miles, so we planned to take our time in the morning to hike out to them. The hikes through the forest were nice, and soaking in natural hot pools was even nicer. The guys jumped in the icy cold river afterward to experience the contrast, but to me that just sounded unpleasant.

After our detours to the hot springs it was growing late in the day and we still hadn't gotten very far. So we cranked out 40 miles with hardly a break. The scenery along the river was incredible but repetitive. Every time we came around a bend in the road it was the same view as the bend before, a whole day of deja vu.

We finally stopped at an isolated town called Lowell. We had dinner at a diner before heading to a campground just outside of town. We were greeted by the last thing I expected to find in Idaho: a real white sand beach. The sand was as soft and fine as any you'd find in the Caribbean, except instead of an tropical blue ocean it was next to a fast-moving, trout-filled river in the middle of a forest.

We drank beers in the sand, went for a refreshing dip in the icy cold water, and then settled in for the night. You would think I'd have no problem sleeping after a long day of biking, but my night was haunted by bizarre dreams about malicious strangers approaching our campsite. Weird, vivid dreams seem to come to me more frequently on this trip, and I was surprised to learn that the guys had experienced that as well. Maybe it has something to do with sleeping in a different, unfamiliar place every night.

We were reluctant to leave our beachside campsite the next morning, even though as the day went on it would only get hotter and hotter. The temperatures had been reaching the high 90s, making it more essential to get an earlier start, though we would never really succeed in making that a habit.

We had a ridiculously long and steep climb awaiting us halfway through the day on a road deceptively named Lamb Grade. The country road started out with a series of manageable switchbacks before just shooting up at an unbikeable angle. We had no choice but to walk our bikes with slow, effortful steps. The midday sun scorched us on the exposed ridge.

The road temporarily leveled out, and we stopped at a lone house on the hill with a water spigot in the yard. We were beyond caring about trespassing and helped ourselves to some much-needed cold water. We then sought shade under a tin roof of a barn-like shelter. A lady came out on the porch of the house and seemed to be watching us warily. Ryan approached her amicably, serving as the ambassador to the group. When he came back, the only message he had to relay from the simple, hilltop-residing woman was this: "You haven't even gotten to the steep part yet." Later on we would get even more advice shouted from a passing truck: "You took a bad way!" The locals were just so helpful.

The going was slow and rough, and the road did indeed get steeper before it finally leveled out into high plains. We had a ferocious headwind to contend with, but the dreamy pastoral landscape made it easier to bear. The road zig-zagged through wheat fields that made me understand the meaning of "amber waves of grain."

A friend from San Francisco (and fellow Rice alum) had contacted me a few weeks before saying he was leaving for his own bike trip. We were following a similar route in opposite directions and were anticipating the day we would run into each other. That day on that windy plain in the middle of Idaho, we got to high five on our way to opposite coasts. It seemed an appropriately contrasting setting for two people who met in Berkeley.

In the next town we decided we were done for the day and gorged ourselves at a pizzeria. We had only made it 45 miles, but it felt like a much longer day. We headed for the town park, pitched our tents, and watched a slow-pitch game.

The next morning we got another late start, thanks to an amazing coffeeshop in Grangeville with lattes and soft couches that invited us to linger. We spent the whole morning there reading and writing and imbibing caffeine.

The guys played a game of hacky sack in the parking lot to warm up, and then by noon we finally set off. It was a beautiful day with a welcome chill in the air after so many days of scorching heat. 

We had yet another steep climb up an endless, switchbacked country road, but this one was so much more pleasant than the day before, we were surprised when we reached the top. I think Lamb Grade Rd shifted our perception of difficulty - Now, any hill we could pedal and not have to push the bike up seemed pretty reasonable.

Our two days of climbing were finally rewarded with quiet roads and a long dive into a desert-y canyon. The screech of a bird pierced the still, dry air and made us feel like we were galloping into an old Western film on our trusty steeds.

The next segment followed the Salmon River through the canyon for miles. We came across another beach and stopped to walk barefoot through the pristine white sand.

We all continued on at our own pace, each of us engaged in a one-on-one battle with heat and hills. After traveling with the guys for a few days we had settled into a standard formation. Jeremiah and Ryan would take the lead, Brady would follow a little ways behind them, and I would bring up the rear. I could usually keep up well enough, but when they got out of sight I knew I would catch up with them at the next stop. They were big on taking breaks, so every time I came upon a town I could expect to see some familiar bikes sitting outside the most inviting gas station or cafe.

The blazing heat in that river canyon had me fantasizing about ice cold drinks and juicy fruit. Lo and behold, the road gods provided in the form of a country store that sold local fruit. We feasted on the most flavorful nectarines, peaches, and apricots I have ever had. 

There were no good lodging prospects that night, since we all felt averse to paying $20+ to pitch our tents at an RV campground. So, we decided to keep riding until we found a good spot to stealth camp. We became a little worried when the sun started going down and we still had not seen any viable sites. It seemed like every piece of land was fenced in or plastered with "Posted: No Trespassing" signs. 

Finally, we noticed a "for sale" sign next to a gravel driveway that led downward to an empty plot of land. We snooped around a little and made our way down to a river further back on the property. From down there we couldn't even see the road. We had found our camping spot.

When I ride I often make a game of looking out for nice, concealed spots on the side of the road that would make for good stealth campsites. In theory I love the freedom and adventure of setting up camp wherever I happen to be when the sun goes down, but up until that point I had never gotten the nerve to actually pitch my tent in an unsanctioned place. I am sure I could have done it without any issues, but I also know that staying overnight by myself in a place where I feel I'm not supposed to be would make for disturbed sleep. I'd stay awake anxiously listening to every bump in the night. But I felt much safer in a group.

Once we settled into our home for the night, we gathered together next to the river to make dinner. Without a picnic table or any flat surface to work with, it was a team effort to chop vegetables and precariously balance our cookware on the rocks.

When the sun went down we snuck back up to the main part of the lot and laid out a tarp to sleep on. I didn't even bother blowing up my sleeping pad, because the dry, hay-like grass made a surprisingly comfortable bed. We gazed up at the clearest night sky I have ever seen, pointing out constellations and shooting stars and satellites until we drifted off.

Despite a freezing cold morning I was eager to get going. Our sleeping spot felt exposed and visible in the light of day. Brady, ever the early riser, got a head start, and I followed shortly after him. All four of us reunited at the first diner on the road, where we filled our tummies with a hot breakfast and coffee. A group of elderly locals were having a lively conversation at the table next to us. One man arrived and exclaimed to his friends, "I just ran over a couple of bicycles in the parking lot! They don't belong to any of you, do they?" He turned to our table and gave us a cheeky laugh and a wink. 

Later on, a more serious fellow told us, "I don't want to ruin your day, but I noticed one of you had a flat tire on my way in." Unfortunately, that one wasn't a joke. We all rushed out to see that Ryan's rim was touching the ground. We hung out while he fixed it, played some hacky sack, and then finally hit the road again.

I was listening to The Omnivore's Dilemma on audiobook. Michael Pollan's description of his experience killing chickens was somehow so appalling and engrossing that the big climbs that morning barely phased me. We stopped to take a break on a coffeeshop patio in the next town. Jeremiah brought over some bizarre books from a little free library he found nearby. We sat there for a while lounging and reading Borroughs and Sartre with raised eyebrows.

An older motorcycle rider rolled up and came over to talk to us. He called himself a "peace rider" and launched into a sermon about faith and non-violence and the wrongness of killing animals. I felt that all signs were pointing toward me becoming a vegetarian by the end of the trip.

The rest of the day's ride was notably unpleasant. We had to go through over ten miles of construction and pass by a major lumber yard, which meant riding alongside big, noisy trucks all afternoon. To make things worse, the shoulder kept disappearing on windy stretches of road (just when you need it most), and when we did have a shoulder it was so rutted it was more hazardous than the road itself. 

Once, a semi truck made to pass me right before a blind corner, so I squeezed myself onto the shoulder between the truck and a rock wall. With no margin for error on either side, I hit a rough patch of broken asphalt and skidded alongside the turning truck. I barely managed to keep my bike upright as I careened to a halt. I stared wide-eyed while the truck disappeared around the corner.

After that adrenaline-pumping stretch, we finally made it to a small town and took a snack break outside a gas station, fueling up for the last push of the day. There was supposedly a bike path we could take all the way to the next town, but when we went to check it out we saw it was all loose gravel. No thanks. Even the treacherous road is preferable to that. 

Another long, hot climb later, we ended in a tiny town. I arrived last and wasn't surprised to find the guys at the local dive bar already halfway through a $5 pitcher of beer. We kicked back and talked about everything. I learned about who the guys were, what had brought them together, and what it was like to grow up in the midwest. A few pitchers and a couple of Digiorno pizzas later, we mused about how close we were to the Oregon border, just 30 miles away. We could be there in 3 hours if we wanted. 

None of us had ridden at night before on this trip, but the daytime temperatures were getting absurdly hot. We also reasoned that the TransAmerica racers had ridden all through the night all the way across the country, so why couldn't we? It was late, but we were too wide awake and energized to go camp at the town park. So, with front and rear lights flashing, we set off into the night, heading for our next state. 

At first it was amazing. We had the road entirely to ourselves, not a car in sight. The sky was brilliantly clear, filled with more stars than I had ever seen, and the air was crisp and cool. We had the vague sense that the road was climbing upward, but we couldn't see further than the beam of our front lights. Without the anticipation of a long climb it made it easier to stay in the moment and take the terrain as it came. It continued to get colder, however, and it became clear that we were dealing with a significant change in elevation. 

After 15 miles the initial excitement had worn off, and I was so cold all I could think of was curling up in my sleeping bag. Jeremiah had charged on ahead, clearly the most eager to make it all the way, and Brady had followed after him. Ryan and I made the decision to abort the mission and continue in the morning. We found the nearest flat patch of grass, pulled out our sleeping bags, and slept soundly though not particularly comfortably. 

In the morning I woke to a blazing sun and the soft clanking of cow bells. I rubbed my eyes and saw a herd of heifers and calfs watching me from across the road. After all the anxiety invested in where I'd sleep at night on this trip, it's really laughably simple when you boil it down to its essence. Sleeping doesn't require much space, and you can do it almost anywhere you find yourself, really. Even though, as we would realize in the morning, we were sleeping just feet away from a private driveway, the "This land is my land" property police never showed up, and the passing cars gave no indication that they even noticed the two bicycle bums passed out on the side of the road.
