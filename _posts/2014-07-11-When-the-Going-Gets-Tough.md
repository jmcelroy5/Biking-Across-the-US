####Lander, WY to Dubois, WY (45 mi + 27 hitched)

The morning after my 95-mile day, I was excited to check out a cute coffeeshop I had noticed on the way into Lander. After so many weeks of gas station coffee, I had never been so happy to be served an overpriced latte. The homemade nutella croissant was still warm from the oven, setting a new bar for pastries in my mind.

I stayed at the coffeeshop reading and working on my blog, but finally around noon I knew I had to get back on the road. For some reason my heart and body were just not into the ride that day. A constant headwind didn't help my motivation. I knew it was a bad sign when I already felt impatient to reach my destination after the first few miles.

After about 45 miles with 27 miles left to Dubois it started to rain, and the wind became unbearable. I was so frustrated I started thinking about hitchhiking the rest of the way, which I've never done or even seriously considered before. 

When a strong gust of wind pushed my bike off the road, I gave in. I dismounted, braced myself against the wind, and threw my thumb in the air. The first vehicle, an RV, pulled over immediately. I've heard it's easy to hitchhike as a female, but I didn't expect it to be that easy. My good Samaritans were Frank and Carol, retirees from Wyoming on their way to Alaska.

They dropped me off at a KOA campground in Dubois, where I found a few other Eastbound cyclists and set up my tent next to theirs. When they heard I had hitchhiked they said "Ohh, DNF!" as in "did not finish." I knew they were just joking around, but it compounded the sense of regret that was already growing in me. I didn't realize what a purist I was until then. 

Rationally I know that 27 miles is nothing in the grand scheme of biking across the country, and obviously the experiences you have are far more important than biking every inch of the trail, but I still felt the need to redeem myself to myself. The weather forecast for the following day was even worse, so I vowed to tough it out no matter what.

####Dubois, WY to Jenny Lake in Grand Teton National Park 

There are perhaps only 3 other rides in my life that caused more nervous anticipation than this one (my very first long distance ride to Santa Cruz, my first solo overnight trip in Marin, and my second day in Eastern Kentucky). 

What was I so afraid of this time? It was supposed to rain all day, the headwind was going to be stronger than the day before, there was a daunting mountain to climb, and I was entering grizzly bear country. Even if I survived the rain, the wind, the mountain, and the bears, then I was worried about camping in the cold. I was going to a higher elevation where the lows were below freezing, and I wasn't sure my layers and sleeping bag would suffice.

But of course, as with most things we dread in life, the anticipation is far more painful than the experience of the thing itself. The day I had so nervously anticipated, though not free of discomfort or challenges, turned out to be one of the best days of the trip. I recalled a mantra that kept playing in my mind when my friends and I biked to Santa Cruz: high risk, high reward. 

Before leaving town I found a thrift store and bought a cozy fleece jacket for $3. it was possibly the most value I've ever gotten for $3. Just thinking about it nestled behind me in my pannier gave me warm fuzzies, and putting it on when I got to the campsite would be my reward for toughing out the cold, wet day. It's the little creature comforts when you're bike touring!

The ride got off to a good start, and the forecasted rain seemed to be holding off. The ascent up to Togwotee Pass was long but gradual. I'm pretty sure I leveled up in bike touring when I managed to eat a whole snack pack of goldfish out of my handlebar bag while climbing the mountain without ever dismounting my bike. Multi-tasking at its finest.

LB, my host in Lamont, had made me promise not to camp past Lander, saying that visitors to Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks are killed every year in bear attacks. I knew it was irrational to fear such an improbable occurrence (especially when cars remain my biggest threat), but I couldn't help but feel nervous about entering bear country. 

I stopped at a lodge on the way up the mountain for an apple cider and got to talking to a man who worked there about bears. He told me some cars coming the other way had reported seeing a mother bear and her cub "just up the road." Uhhh, how far is just up the road? Are we talking yards or miles? 

He started advising me on what to do if a bear started "stalking" me or attacked me in my tent. Seeing my facial expression, another lady who worked there intervened and reassured me. She said bears avoid humans, so if I'm ever out hiking I should talk to myself out loud. Park rangers' advice for bear encounters is to make yourself big and yell "Hey bear, hey bear!" You should never turn and run - You'd make yourself look like prey.

Biking up the mountain, I was on high alert. The deep, lovely woods and rushing streams on either side of me looked like perfect bear habitat. Thinking about the lady's advice, I started saying out loud "Hey bear, hey bear.... Scare bear, no bear... Go away bear..." Fortunately there was no one around to witness this ridiculousness.

There were snow drifts on the roadside as I neared the pass, and it was getting chilly. After crossing the Continental Divide for the umpteenth time, a sign indicated a 6% descent for the next 17 miles. I stopped and put on every layer I had (except for the treasured fleece) in preparation for a freezing descent. It was too cold and wet to take my phone out for photos, so I stole this one from Mike's blog:

On the way down it began to rain and hail. I lost feeling in my extremities and had to test my hands every so often to make sure I could still pull the brakes. After several miles of this, I was so relieved when I came across a hotel. I walked into the lobby looking like a drowned rat and was overjoyed to find seven other cyclists warming up near the fire nursing cups of free coffee. 

Five of the cyclists there were racing the Great Divide trail, a mountain bike route from Canada to Mexico. It's hard to explain how ridiculously hardcore that is. They had braved every kind of terrain, miserable weather, snow drifts 9 feet deep, impossibly steep hills, heinous injuries, and stretches as long as 150 miles with no civilization. The three TransAm cyclists listened wide-eyed to their stories that made biking across the country on roads, where you could at least count on a gas station every 30 miles, seem like a cakewalk.

After an hour or so, there was a break in the storm, and we all reluctantly continued on our way. With the sun partially out, the remainder of the descent was much more bearable, and the beautiful Grand Tetons came into view. (Side note: The name literally means "big breasts." Who the hell let the French name our mountains?)

The sun didn't last long, and I ended up battling more rain over the remaining 40 miles. I was determined to make it to Jenny Lake in Grand Teton National Park, where I knew there would be hiker/biker sites. Campers without vehicles receive something of a celebrity treatment in national parks - Hiker/biker campsites are cheap (often around $5), and I knew they wouldn't turn me away, even though a sign near the park entrance indicated the campground was full.

I finally rolled up to Jenny Lake around 8 pm (an especially long day for me) and found a group of cyclists around a campfire. Tuan was among them, and I was excited to hear about his post-Pueblo adventures. I also enjoyed talking to another solo female cyclist. She and I agreed that our toughest days on the road have a way of making us feel happier and more alive than a good day back at home.

After the fire died out and we all retired to our tents, I luxuriated in changing into dry clothes and snuggling into my new fleece. It had been a truly epic day, and I was proud of myself for rising to the occasio
