excerpt: "Robin Williams once said of Glacier National Park, 'If it's not God's backyard, then he certainly lives nearby.' That quote kept playing in my head as I spun my pedals in low gear, climbing up the Going-to-the-Sun Road. My head swiveled to take in the expansive vista that spread out like a painting beyond a low stone wall that separated the narrow road I was on from a steep drop-off into the V-shaped valley. The landscape was surreal: a range of colorful, jaunty mountains striped with snowfields that glowed in the morning light. With every turn in the road, the views became even grander. Glacial meltwater streamed down from the cliffs on the opposite side of the road, spraying me with cold crystal droplets."

Robin Williams once said of Glacier National Park, "If it's not God's backyard, then he certainly lives nearby." That quote kept playing in my head as I spun my pedals in low gear, climbing up the Going-to-the-Sun Road. My head swiveled to take in the expansive vista that spread out like a painting beyond a low stone wall that separated the narrow road I was on from a steep drop-off into the V-shaped valley. The landscape was surreal: a range of colorful, jaunty mountains striped with snowfields that glowed in the morning light. With every turn in the road, the views became even grander. Glacial meltwater streamed down from the cliffs on the opposite side of the road, spraying me with cold crystal droplets.

A side trip up to northern Montana has been in my bike trip plans since the beginning, as I had heard that Glacier's Going-to-the-Sun road is one of the most beautiful highways in the world and a bucket list bike ride. The plan got even better, though, when my friend, Jeremy, got in touch to let me know he was going to be riding his motorcycle through Montana around that time. We decided we would rent a car in Missoula and spend a few days in Glacier, saving me the 3-day ride up there. He even rented a bike so he could join me on Going-to-the-Sun road.
 
The first night we stayed in Apgar campground on the west side of the park and plotted our ascent up GTTS. The park restricts bike travel on the narrow, winding, mountainous stretch of the road is certain hours. We would have to get up to the highest point, Logan Pass, by 11:00 am, which meant we would have to get up at the crack of dawn for the 32 mile climb.

The beginning of the ride went along Lake McDonald, a glassy lake that perfectly mirrored its mountainous backdrop in soft pastels. Then the road followed a rushing river the color of toothpaste, which is where we had the realization that the concept of "icy blue" isn't just the product of food marketers' imagination. Glacial water actually takes on that unique hue. Though, of course, nature's version is far more stunning than Gatorade's imitation could suggest.

At one point we put on the brakes when we saw a small dark figure run across the road ahead of us. It was a little black bear. He was just sitting on the side of the road now, watching us watching him. After a few minutes of this, we made motions to move and he scampered off into the woods.

With about 12 miles left to go to the pass, the real climb began. Biking proved to be the perfect speed to take in the incredible views. And, of course, I couldn't miss the opportunities for some epic bike glamour shots.

Despite our best efforts to wake up early, we didn't make it up to Logan pass in time but about a half an hour late. The only consequence, though, was a light reprimand from a park ranger passing by in his truck. The top of the pass was covered in snow. Snow and a gigantic parking lot for a visitor's center. Jeremy and I found a place to rest and shovel handfuls of trail mix into our mouths. 

Logan Pass also turned out to be the habitat of mountain goats, who seemed undaunted by the throngs of visitors in their home.

Though the park rules restrict bike travel going up the mountain, there are no restrictions for going down the mountain. Flying down, enjoying the views in reverse, was our reward for the tough climb. The only challenge was keeping our brakes clenched to stay in line with the slow-moving traffic.

That evening we returned to Lake McDonald around sunset. It was the most beautiful lake I had ever seen, and I wanted to swim in it to experience it more fully. Jeremy lent me his biodegradable soap so I could make a bath of it. The water was beyond freezing, and it took me 30 excruciating minutes of easing into it before I finally got the courage to dunk my head. I immediately popped back up, breathless. All the pain was worth it for the most scenic bath of my life.

When we returned to the campsite we made a pretty extravagant dinner of steak fajitas with rice, black beans, corn, and salsa. This was one of many successful camp stove meals on the trip. We also made chili mac (always a satisfying go-to), pasta with broccoli and tuna in a white sauce, and biscuits and bacon. When I'm traveling by myself I usually just revert to ramen or canned soup, so it was fun to have someone to cook with.

The next day we packed up and drove to Many Glacier, a campground on the opposite side of the park. It's a highly-coveted place to stay, almost always filling up before noon, so we were thrilled to find a perfect campsite at 11:00 am. 

Many of the park's most popular day hikes leave from Many Glacier, and we did several of them during our three days there. Each one was magical. Wildflowers, waterfalls, icy blue lakes, mountains: It was almost too much to take in. We were spoiled by stunning scenery by the end of it and began to worry about ourselves when we realized that the views did not affect us as strongly as they did in the beginning. I guess you can get used to anything, even paradise.

The original plan was to drive back to Missoula after that, but then I remembered an email from my friend and former coworker, Becca, that said she would be passing through West Glacier on an Amtrak tour of the US. I looked back at the email and realized she would be there the following Tuesday. It would have been a shame to miss her by just a few days, and there was still more of Glacier I wanted to see, so I decided I would stay and explore the park with her. Poor Jeremy had to drive the rental car back to Missoula by himself, pick up his motorcycle, and then drive back so he could continue into Canada for the next destination on his trip: climbing in Banff.

I camped at a hiker/biker site near the west entrance to the park, so I could ride out early the next morning and meet Becca when her train came in. I was joined by some amazing bike tourists, including a German woman who had just biked across Canada (east to west) and is now on her way down to South America, as well as the man who started Warmshowers, the hospitality website for bike tourists that I've relied on several times on this trip.

It stormed like crazy that night, so I didn't get to talk to my fellow campers as long as I would have liked before I had to take refuge in my tent. The next morning I packed up my wet tent at 5 am and biked the 10 miles to meet Becca for breakfast in West Glacier. I stopped on the way to take another look at Lake McDonald, which seemed to change character every time I saw it depending on the light. It was particularly spectacular this time, nearly moving me to tears at the sight of it.

It was kind of a mind bender to see Becca outside the context of work and the Bay Area. We lingered over numerous refills of coffee, chatting at a million miles an hour to catch up on each other's lives since I had left. 

Becca had rented an adorable cabin at a campground just outside the park and very kindly invited me to stay with her for the two nights. Her first day we walked several miles into the park then took a shuttle to a trailhead for a 5-ish mile hike to Avalanche Lake. The trail went through a dense forest of thousand-year-old cedar trees. The woods were so lovely and lush, I kept expecting to see fairies or other mythical creatures pop out from behind the trees.

The next day Becca rented a car so we could get see more of the park and not have to rely on the shuttle. We drove over Going-to-the-Sun road all the way to Many Glacier, stopping for several short hikes. We finally headed back late in the evening. By that point we nearly had the road all to ourselves. It was amazing to experience Going-to-the-Sun again at twilight.

To take advantage of having the car, we drove to the next down for dinner to get out of the park's high price zone. We ate at an A&W then hit up a grocery store so Becca could stock up for her long 30ish hour train ride to Chicago the next day. The next morning I took Becca to the train station.

After seeing her off, I returned to the cabin to get a few more hours of sleep. Then I got back on the bike and headed toward Missoula, where I would rejoin the TransAm and continue my westward progress. The nearly two weeks bumming around Glacier had been a good vacation from my vacation.
