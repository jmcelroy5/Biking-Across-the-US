There are several points in this region where the TransAmerican Trail runs into the Appalachian Trail. The AT is a hiking trail that runs all the way from Georgia to Maine, and it's an incredibly popular hike among people of all ages looking for an adventure and with 5 to 6 months to spare. 

The other night I stayed in a small town called Troutville, where they allow TA cyclists and AT hikers to camp in their park. They had a large three-wall wooden shelter that mimics the shelters along the AT, where I laid out my sleeping pad and bag. 

When I arrived at the park it was just beginning to rain hard, and I felt so relieved to get my bike under the shelter. Just as I was heaving a sigh of relief that I had missed the worst of the rain, a pack of kids ran up and starting spraying me and my bike with their supersoaker water guns. Really cute.

Finally the kids' birthday party ended and I was alone in the park. I fell asleep around 10:00, but then around midnight I was awoken to the sound of rustling bags and someone blowing up a sleeping pad. It was a young AT hiker whose arrival was followed shortly by an elderly AT hiker. We all chatted a bit as they got set up, and then we settled down to get some sleep.

Just as I was drifting off again, I heard country music in the distance that seemed to grow louder. I sat up and was startled to see a young man in all camo approaching with a small pack on his back and a long stick in his hands. He called out to us, despite the fact that we were all obviously sleeping. I felt bewildered and distrustful.

It turned out this camo-clad country boy was another AT hiker, but unlike the others his pack was ultralight, because, as he explained, "This ain't my first rodeo." He set up his sleeping bag next to mine and proceeded to talk my ears off for the next hour. As we talked, though, my wariness dissipated and I began to trust and respect him. He told me about growing up in Kentucky, his love life, his ex-wife, his adventures traveling around the US, that one time when he rigged a chainsaw motor to a bicycle, and how he manages to hike more than double the daily mileage of the average AT hiker.

His trail name was Fin, and he had been hanging out at the fire station in Troutville for several days waiting for a friend to catch up. Fin had made a valuable place for himself among the firefighters, cooking elaborate meals for them every night and cleaning the station during the day. "I like to work. I can't not work," he said. After dinner one night the fire lieutenant had handed him a job application and asked him if he could stay.

The next morning I joined him and the other two hikers at the fire station for breakfast and coffee. My plan for the day was to do a short ride of 20 miles to the next town (called Catawba), because the weather forecast was looking really bad, and also because my knee had been hurting since the climbing day so I felt I should lay off it for a bit. I won't lie, an additional reason for the short day was an all-you-can-eat restaurant in Catawba called the Homeplace that several people had raved to me about. It didn't open until dinnertime, so staying overnight in town would give me a chance to eat there then promptly go into a food coma.

The ACA map indicated that the Catawba general store allowed cyclists to camp behind it, but pitching a tent in pouring rain sounded rather unpleasant. Luckily for me, the AT hikers told me about the Four Pines hostel near there that turned out to be only a minor detour from the TransAm route. The hostel was donation-based and offered a shuttle to the Homeplace. Score!

I rolled up to Four Pines then headed down a gravel driveway, passing a pasture of alpacas and dodging the chickens and roosters that were roaming around freely. The hostel was essentially the owner's garage, where he had set up a bunch of cots and couches. There was even a kitchen and a shower. A bunch of AT hikers were already there, playing games and drinking, and they expected a lot more to arrive throughout the day because of the foul weather.

The owner, Joe, was thrilled to see a cyclist. His hostel used to be on the TransAm map, but he shut it down for a few years to raise alpacas and hadn't gotten back on the updated version of the map. I promised him I'd email the ACA to suggest that they add it.

At dinnertime we all hopped in Joe's beat-up van to drive to the Homeplace. The wait was an hour and a half, but the chance to talk to all the AT hikers made it fly by. The hikers were from all over the US: Kentucky, Tennessee, Michigan, New York, etc. They were at all different stages of life, and they all had unique reasons for doing the trail. Some were clearly in it for the fun and party aspect, some were taking a break while transitioning jobs and careers, and some were avid outdoorsman who had already conquered the Pacific Crest Trail and saw the AT as the next challenge. 

One hiker I spoke to who was in his mid-60s viewed the AT as a journey of self-healing. His wife had passed away six years ago, and before she went she asked him to scatter her ashes in a way that would be symbolic and meaningful to him, that would allow him to let go and continue living his life. So he decided to do it when he reached Mt. Katahdin, the final summit of the Appalachian Trail.

I have read books about the AT and even briefly entertained the idea of doing it myself, so it was interesting to learn more about it firsthand. Since I was the one odd cyclist in the group, the contrast between the AT and the TA became starkly apparent. 

More than once I was questioned about how much weight I was carrying on my bike, and I had to laugh. As gear obsessed and weight conscious as I was in my bike trip preparation, backpackers are afflicted by this to a much greater degree. Everyone knew how much their pack weighed, and they could probably itemize everything they carried down to the ounce.

One thing I did not realize is what an intensely social experience hiking the AT is. There are thousands of hikers out on the trail, and not a day goes by that you don't run into others. Hikers usually hike in groups they call "bubbles," and if they fall behind a bubble they can always merge into another. On rainy nights hikers crowd into the shelters along the trail. Someone joked that the sound of air leaving a sleeping pad is the "hiker alarm clock." All the hikers carried earplugs to deal with snoring, and I had to borrow a pair at the hostel. 

The hikers form a strong bond and sense of community through sharing the trail experience. To an outsider, they seem almost cult-like. No one uses their real names, but rather their trail names, which are affectionately given to them by their fellow hikers. Among the hostelers I met were Zoom, Scout, Packrat, Journeyman, Solo, and Listener. 

There is a whole slew of trail lingo I had to learn to keep up with their conversation. There's whiteblazing, which refers to following the white blazes that mark the official trail, and blueblazing, which refers to the blue blazes that often designate a shortcut trail. The hostel owner offered to help some of the hikers "slackpack," which is when someone drives your backpack to a town further up the trail and you just hike with a daypack to get a break from the weight. The purists look down on blueblazing and slackpacking. 

There are also trail angels and trail magic. Trail angels are generous locals who will shuttle hikers from the trail into town or even offer overnight stays in their homes. Trail magic is when a trail angel leaves a nice, morale-boosting surprise on the trail for hikers to stumble upon, like cold water, beers, or candy.

For all the camaraderie, AT is still an incredible mental and physical challenge that is not for the faint of heart. They say only 10% of hikers who set out intending to hike the whole thing actually make it to the end. Carrying weight on your back over rough terrain is way more exhausting than biking. I noticed that the hikers' feet were covered in blisters, and their toenails were turning black and blue. They're away from civilization for days at a time, and they have to plan their day's mileage based on the location of water sources and shelters. If they want to get to a town to re-supply on food they usually have to hitchhike there from the trail.

Spending time with the AT hikers was interesting, but it actually made me feel even better about my decision to bike across the US. Bike touring just suits me better. After two days of socializing, I was exhausted and ready to retreat into my head to think and reflect. If I were on the trail, I wouldn't get a chance to do that. 

Also, I find I am motivated by changing scenery and constant forward motion; You can cover a lot more ground and see a much wider variety of landscapes when you're traveling at 10 miles per hour rather than 10 miles per day. I like to rough it, but I also like to be close to the conveniences of civilization and to see how people live in the towns I pass through.

I also like the freedom of independently deciding how far I'm going to go and what I'm going to do each day. Having to navigate social dynamics or wait on others or rely on group decision making would feel constraining. Not that it wouldn't be a wonderful growth experience, but it's just not the kind of adventure I'm looking for right now.

Bike touring is certainly a more solitary experience. For my entire first week of riding I had only seen one other group of TransAm bikers, who I passed up and never saw again. This means that I need to work a little harder to ward off loneliness. I have to go a little more out of my way engage with people along the trip, but that is a challenge that I welcome. Years of traveling and CouchSurfing have taught me how to make fleeting but meaningful connections with people I meet. I enjoy meeting a wide variety of people and getting a little glimpse of their lives when our trails interse
