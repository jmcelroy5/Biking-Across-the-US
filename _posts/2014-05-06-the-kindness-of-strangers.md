When you talk to people who have travelled a lot, one thing they will tell you is that people everywhere are generally good, and they will undoubtedly have stories about times when strangers went out of their way to help them. Traveling alone on this bike trip, I  expected to have to rely on the kindness and hospitality of strangers, from asking for directions to staying overnight at the many churches that offer lodging for cyclists along the TransAmerica Trail. 

I could not have expected, however, the unsolicited kindness I've already experienced in just a few days of biking. People wave at me from their porches and yards as I ride by, drivers have stopped to ask where I'm headed and wish me luck, and gas station clerks have offered helpful local knowledge. But not only have people been friendly and curious, a few have been incredibly generous. Here are some particularly touching stories, all from yesterday:

#### An Encounter with a Kindhearted Veteran

Riding along a country road, an old-fashioned log cabin caught my eye. A sign in the yard said it was called Church Quarter, one of a few preserved homes in the area from the 1700s. As I was standing there taking a picture, a man pulled up in a pickup truck and walked toward me. "Wanna hear the history behind it?," he asked, and then went on to tell me the story of the woman who lived here who had a group of soldiers appear at her door one day asking for something to drink. She gave them a pitcher of water, and after the first man finished drinking she recognized him as Stonewall Jackson. Before the other men could get a sip, she took the pitcher of water away, wanting to preserve it as a memento.

He introduced himself as Jimmy Harris and asked me where I was headed on my bike. When I said my destination was the coast of Oregon, he immediately lit up with excitement. He said he has daughters my age and took off his glasses to wipe tears from his clear blue eyes. Then he took out his wallet and handed me money! He said he had just gotten a retroactive check from the VA and that's what that came from. I pleaded with him, saying it was just too generous and I couldn't accept it, but he was adamant that he wanted to give it to me. I just hope I can pay his kindness forward!

I received an email from him today, and in addition to telling me to call him if I find myself in a bind, he said the most beautiful thing: "I taught at a Christian School for a while and I told the kids there that I loved them.  I made sure they understood that my definition of love was caring about them and being concerned for their well being. With that being said, I love you. Enjoy and be safe." 

#### Jimmy's Story

Jimmy fought in Vietnam, and when he came back from the war he was homeless for a long time and struggled with symptoms of PTSD. He said that looking back he is actually grateful for the time he was homeless, because it showed him how much goodness there is in the world. He is now a passionate advocate for the cause of veteran homelessness and said he once walked all the way from Richmond to DC to raise awareness. 

On this bike trip, I am essentially homeless by choice, and I'm finding that things do just tend to work themselves out. That's one of the reasons I wanted to do this trip, to learn resourcefulness and to experience the liberation of being at home out in the world. But I cannot imagine being homeless due to lack of options. I especially cannot imagine what it feels like to come back from fighting a war, expecting to be taken care of, only to feel cast away from society in your own country. It is incredible that he thinks of his experience so positively when most would feel embittered! "What a wonderful world we live in!" he said, and those words will stick with me. 

####Another Random Act of Kindness

Biking down Pottiesville Road in a town called Bumpass (I don't make this stuff up), a truck with an "Animal Control" decal passed me up then pulled over and stopped on the side of the road just ahead of me. As I rode by, the driver called out, "You all by yourself?" I stopped and responded truthfully, but kept my distance, feeling a bit wary since there was no one else around. He got out of his truck with a little can in his hand and said "Here, take this. It's pepper spray for dogs. I try to keep the county clean but sometimes they still run loose, and they like to chase after bikes." So, thanks to another caring stranger, now I am prepared for dog attacks! I have heard the dogs in Kentucky are the worst, so I had actually been planning to buy some before I got there.

####The Incredible Hospitality of Firefighters in Mineral, VA

Mineral was my final destination yesterday, because I saw on my map that the volunteer fire station lets TransAm cyclists camp out there. I had called a few times earlier in the day but no one answered. When I arrived I poked my head into the station and through a window I saw a man sitting in an office chair with his head tipped backward, fast asleep. I hung around until finally a firefighter came out and I asked him about camping on their lot. I was pleasantly surprised when he invited me to stay inside instead so I wouldn't have to be out in the rain! 

He gave me a tour of the station, introducing me to the other firefighters and showing me where the kitchen, laundry, showers, and bathrooms were. Shortly after I arrived, two emergencies came over the intercom right in a row, both car accidents. When they all came back from responding to the emergency a little later (fortunately there were no serious injuries) they invited me to sit on the couches and watch TV with them. I ended up having the women's bunk all to myself for the night, where I slept in a real bed! I was one happy camper and so appreciative of their warm hospitality
