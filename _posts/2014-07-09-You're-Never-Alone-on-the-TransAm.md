####Breckenridge, CO to Hot Sulphur Springs, CO (72 mi)

In the morning Lisa prepared an amazing egg and avocado bagel sandwich and a coffeeshop-quality latte and sent me me off with some delicious, healthy snacks for the road. The first 20-30 miles were carefree riding along paved bike paths through Silverthorne and Frisco, mountain towns not too different from Breckenridge.

I felt really good after taking a day off, and I managed to knock through all but the last fifteen miles by early afternoon. I stopped to eat lunch outside a gas station and call a friend from home. By the time I got off the phone I wished I had pushed through to the end, because I could now see an encroaching storm and lightning in the distance. The rest of the ride I nervously tried to stay ahead of it.

Two other cyclists were trailing me at a distance for a while, but I was too focused on beating the rain to slow down and talk. When they eventually caught up I was happily surprised to see it was Esther and Warren! I thought they would have been way ahead of me, but it turned out they had holed up near Breckenridge with altitude sickness for a few days. 

They tend to be a little particular about their riding companions, so I laughed in delight when Warren greeted me saying "You're one of the few people we would've hoped to see again!" And truthfully, I was happy to see them, too. Esther and Warren are full of stories and tidbits of touring advice learned through years of experience. I like their style and pace of travel.They are strong and fast riders, but they always find time for stopping to take pictures, and they have a policy of never passing up an open diner. 

I find it amazing that they have been biking around the world, spending virtually every minute together for the past four years. To me a harmonious travel partnership might as well be the definition of true love. It's beautiful the way they genuinely enjoy each other's company after all this time and how they not only accept but find humor in the other's quirks.

We camped in a wildlife refuge outside of Hot Sulphur Springs, one of the first real primitive camping experiences of the whole trip. We claimed a beautiful, secluded site right next to the Colorado River. The only downside was that it was infested with mosquitoes. I was forced to retreat to my tent prematurely, nearly driven to insanity by the swarms that were managing to bite me through multiple layers of clothing.

Warren and Esther stayed outside a bit longer with bug nets over their heads. They made several rounds of tea with river water and were even so kind to share with me. Having a delicious hot drink delivered right to your tent on a cold night is the best thing ever. I read until dark then happily fell asleep to the sound of rain and of soft laughter from the other tent.

####Hot Sulphur Springs, CO to Walden, CO (63 mi)

Esther, Warren, and I got a leisurely start at the campground, chatting about gear and preparing breakfast. Here we are finally heading out:

The road from the campground into Hot Sulphur Springs wound through an epic river gorge.

We stopped for second breakfast at a cute cafe in Hot Sulphur Springs with a not-so-cute name: The Glory Hole. By the time we had lingered over our third cup of coffee, it was growing late for hitting the road.

The ride that day was perhaps one of my favorites. We went through national forest land, where the hills were blanketed in aspens and the valleys laced with winding rivers. We were starting to see some interesting rock formations, too. We had one major mountain climb, another Continental Divide crossing, but by now these don't pose too much of a challenge.

Warren and Esther rode ahead of me most of the day, but I would sometimes catch up with them when they stopped to take photos. I also caught up with them when they took a break to chat with the owner at a quaint gift store, a really welcome surprise in the middle of nowhere. 

The road quality was poor in the area. Every few feet there was a horizontal crack, so we were plagued by the sound of our bikes going *kerdunk, kerdunk, kerdunk* for miles and miles. On the final stretch we fought an intense crosswind for over an hour.

We were so glad when the road miraculously bent right, though, ending the day on a marvelous tailwind.
We had heard the mosquitoes at the town park in Walden were unbearable, and the low was supposed to get into the low 30s that night. I normally like to camp whenever possible, but I decided to save some misery and check into a motel with Esther and Warren. Their room had a kitchen, so we bought ingredients and made a big pasta dinner together.

Out on Main Street I met another solo female cyclist near my age. She hadn't decided where to stay yet, so I offered to share my motel room with her. We stayed up late talking about our experiences and the characters we've both met. We laughed about how many people have expressed concern for us as females traveling alone and how we actually never really feel alone on the road, anyway.

Unfortunately she wasn't a viable riding partner, because she does about double my daily mileage. She seemed to have an entirely different approach to the TransAm: She's into the sport of biking and lives for going fast and cranking out the miles, whereas I just view biking as my preferred mode/speed of travel. I'm more interested in what biking allows me to see rather than the biking itself. In any case, what she's doing is impressive! She started her trip nearly 3 weeks after me, and she'll probably reach the coast any day now.
