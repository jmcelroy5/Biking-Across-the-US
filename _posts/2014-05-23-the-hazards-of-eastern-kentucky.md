The Hazards of Eastern Kentucky

After nearly two weeks of blissful, carefree riding through Virginia, I crossed the Kentucky state line and things changed pretty distinctly as the wide open pastoral landscapes gave way to steep, winding mountain roads and wooded valleys. Eastern Kentucky posed many new challenges, which will be the subject of this post, starting with a lengthy tirade about the biggest threat of all:

###1. Loose Dogs!

Kentuckians have a lot of dogs. In some areas it seems like there are more dogs than people. Many of these dogs are just left to run loose around the countryside, and they love to chase after bikes. 

I know the dog lovers among you are probably thinking "Aww, but they're just playing! I'm sure they don't mean any harm." That's what I thought, too, when I heard from previous TransAmerican cyclists that dogs are a problem in Eastern Kentucky. I didn't understand how bad it could be... until I had a german shepherd chasing me at an all-out sprint, snarling and nipping at my heels!

There's definitely something different about the dogs in Appalachia. The ones that give chase aren't kidding around. Maybe their owners encourage them to be territorial to guard their land, or maybe they're just not trained at all, so they're not socialized to respond to human reprimands.

The very first encounter I had with a bad dog, it come flying out of nowhere and nearly made me swerve into oncoming traffic. My instinct was to get off my bike so I wouldn't crash and also to show the dog that I was a human, not a monster with wheels for legs. That seemed to lower his aggression a little, but it continued to bark and growl viciously.

I stood still and tried to keep my bike in between me and the dog. It was trying to circle around behind me and snap at my legs, so I just kept repositioning my bike and yelling at it, hoping its owner would show up and call him off. Every little movement I made caused the dog to get riled up, so we just stood there staring each other down and circling around. Finally a car came along and let me use it as a shield to walk away. I walked off to a safe distance and saw that the dog was standing in the same place, still staring at me. As soon as I started riding off, he came chasing again, but I was too far away at that point for him to catch up. 

I did have a can of "Halt" (dog pepper spray) on me for self-defense, but it was packed away in my panniers that time. After that incident I started carrying it in an outer pocket of my handlebar bag. 

The next couple of days were really rough, because I was so consumed by fear of the dogs. It may sound ridiculous, but I actually had trouble falling asleep at night, because I was dreading the dog encounters the next day would bring.

I started to be hyper-alert as I was riding, almost to the point of paranoia, ready for a dog to come out of nowhere. Every house was a potential site for a loose dog, so I passed by as quietly as I could, with bated breath. Even the sound of a bird or squirrel rustling in the trees beside the road would make me jump.

It didn't help that I was getting messages from Tuan, who was a few days' riding ahead of me, warning me about mean dog packs he had just narrowly escaped. One night at a cyclist's hostel my host told me that his neighbor's dogs (tiny dogs!) had killed two of his cats, plus another story about a woman in Ohio who was mauled to death by Rottweilers. That didn't do much to allay my fears!

I wrote to my two friends who have ridden the TransAmerica in previous years, Jay and Mercedes, to get their advice. Jay said his strategy was just to yell at them and bike fast to get away. But with hills and a fully-loaded bike and the fact that dogs can come out in front of you on the road, I didn't believe I could bike fast enough to get away in all cases. 

Mercedes had some solid advice she had garnered from her ACA-organized tour. Her key piece of advice was to remember that the biggest danger dogs pose is their ability to cause you to crash. A dog bite may injure you or derail your trip, but it'll cause less damage than colliding with a car or flying off your bike. She said when dogs come out ahead of you, it's best to get off your bike and face them on two feet, yell at them sternly using downward hand motions, and try to walk around them, keeping your pepper spray at the ready in case they come at you. 

I still had some hostile encounters after that, but I got much more confident at handling them. And the confidence itself helped a lot.You have to out-alpha the dogs, because the mean ones are like bullies -  They sense fear and will try to exert their dominance when they feel they can win. I learned a bit about dog psychology and even fancied myself something of a dog whisperer when I succeeded in turning a few of the growling beasts into fuzzy, tail-wagging friends.

###2. The Appalachians

I had heard that the Appalachians were the toughest part of the entire TransAmerican Trail, and they certainly lived up to their reputation! Supposedly even the Rockies and the Sierras are easier, because the roads are built at a gentler grade. 

On some days in Eastern Kentucky I had to get over multiple mountain passes, and each one would seem interminable. Walking wasn't really an option, because once you get off the bike it's hard to get it started again on an incline. You're basically committed to seeing the ascent through. 
Making it up the mountain became a mental game. While granny gearing it up the winding roads, I repeated silly song-like mantras to bolster my spirits, like "Just keep spinning, just keep spinning" (to the tune of "Just keep swimming" from Finding Nemo) and "She'll be comin' around the mountain when she comes." Sounds crazy, but it helped get me through! 

Now that I've emerged from the mountains into the rolling hills of bluegrass country, I am so relieved to have them behind me. One of the best things about riding the TransAm from east to west is that you get the hardest part over with first. With the Appalachians in your legs, you know you can handle anything that lies ahead of you.

###3. Coal Trucks

Once I crossed into Kentucky it became very clear that I had entered coal mining country. I passed by entrances to coal mining zones and saw entire mountaintops stripped bare. I saw yard signs calling to "stop the war on coal," bumper stickers proclaiming that "coal keeps the lights on", and political campaign signs with the slogan "friend of coal." Most of the locals I talked to worked in coal-related jobs.

Many of the roads I travelled on were also coal truck thoroughfares. I was told by a local that coal trucks are paid by the load, not the hour, which means the drivers don't like to get held up. Not only are they loud and unpleasant to ride beside, but there's also the chance that pieces of coal could fly out of their open-top beds. 

Fortunately, though, I found that the vast majority of coal truck drivers were respectful and cautious around me. They would slow down and wait for an opportunity to pass safely, usually getting over into the opposite lane to allow me space. I was really grateful for that! Whenever I had a truck following me for a while, I would try to pull over into a driveway or off on the side of the road to let them go ahead. I figured it wouldn't hurt to build up some good karma with coal trucks.

###4. Rumble Strips and Loose Gravel

The Kentuckian AT hiker I met back in Virginia had warned me about the rumble strips coming up. He told me they're needed for "all the rednecks who drive around drunk," which he followed by saying "Just kidding! But not really."

Sure enough, on every road I rode on in Eastern Kentucky the outer white line was indented with grooves, and the few times when I did have a shoulder it was mostly taken up by an even wider rumble strip. It's like riding on a tightrope - If you stray from riding in a straight line you'll get rattled and jolted awake.

In the very few places where there was a suitable amount of highway shoulder leftover for riding, you still had to ride cautiously, because there were often pebbles or loose gravel scattered there. Hitting a patch of gravel, especially when flying downhill, could make you lose control of your bike, and I had a couple of close calls.

###5. Private Property 

The quintessential American spirit of rugged individualism and pioneer pride is alive and well in the mountains of Eastern Kentucky. The people are very private, and there seems to be a fixation with designating their private property. Houses are spread apart, and almost every single one had some combination of "Private property", "No Trespassing", or "Beware of Dog" sign marking its territory. I had seen some of that in Virginia, but Kentucky was a new extreme. Every piece of property was marked, giving a kind of an ominous and unwelcoming vibe. 

My host at the cyclists' hostel, a native Kentuckian himself, said that he strongly discourages travelers from trying to stealth camp anywhere in Kentucky. He said even if someone gives you permission to pitch your tent on their land, it might not actually be their property or their right to give you permission, and you might find yourself a pawn in a land feud. He also warned that there is a high rate of gun ownership there, and the law allows landowners to shoot if they perceive someone is on their property with intent to harm. 

I observed signs of general distrust and wariness among people there. I had several people come up to me outside of gas stations and grocery stores and tell me I was brave for riding my bike on their roads and that they would never do it themselves. One person scoffed, saying "You have a lot more faith in humanity than I do." More than once I had men warn me to "watch out for idyits out thur." Lucky for me, I found that the idiots were few and far between. Drivers were generally considerate.

###6. Unintelligible Accents

This isn't a hazard, per se, but more a source of confusion and amusement. Eastern Kentuckians have a very distinct accent and way of talking that might as well have been a foreign language to me at times. 

Once I had stopped on the side of the road to reattach something that had fallen off my bike, and a man in a pickup truck pulled up beside me and said something I didn't understand. I figured he was just checking to make nothing was wrong, so I smiled and said, "I'm fine, thanks!" After he rode off I was finally able to parse exactly what he said: "Not all torn up now, is it?" he had asked, referring to my bike. I heard people say this later on, too. They use the phrase "torn up" to mean "broken down."

Another time I stopped into a McDonalds for a lunch. I placed my order, and the lady asked me, "Ya want tha comby?" I stared at her blankly and asked her to repeat the question, which didn't do anything for my clarity. So, I just hesitantly responded "no?" and finally realized when I got my order that "comby" was her pronunciation of "combo." 

### 7. No Cell Phone Service

The whole time I was in Eastern Kentucky I couldn't get a single bar of cell phone signal. Then when I reached Berea, a college town that marks the transition between the Appalachians and western Kentucky's bluegrass land, I suddenly had a full signal. Since then it's been hit or miss, but I can usually get a bar or two when I get into a town. 

### 8. Dry Counties

Many counties in Kentucky are "dry," which means you can't buy alcohol there, not even beer or wine. Actually, this works out in my favor as a cyclist who is entrusting my life in the hands of drivers! That's why it's at the bottom of the list. I just thought it was amusing. Also, for all my beer-loving friends, you might consider it a hazard that even when beer is available, it's usually Bud Light or something similar. The horror! 

### The Good Parts

As entertaining as it is to rant about the challenges and quirks of Eastern Kentucky, it would be an unfair characterization if I did not also talk about its positive aspects. I found Kentucky to be a land of extremes - It has the most intense hills and the most vicious dogs, but these were counteracted by the incredible warmth and kindness of people I met. In the next post I'll talk about all the good experiences I had  while traveling through this state, which far outweigh the negative ones.
