#### Cambridge, ID to Richland, OR (70 mi)

Ryan and I resumed the climb from the night before relatively refreshed from our roadside sleep. It was strange to suddenly be able to see the road we had been riding along in pitch black darkness the previous night. By sneaking in some nighttime miles it felt as if we'd teleported ahead. The map showed that we were only a few miles from the summit and a long, steep descent into Hell's Canyon.

As Ryan and I flew down into the canyon, Brady popped out onto the road from a campground. I was stunned that he had done the canyon descent the night before. The hairpin turns must have been scary to navigate in the dark, and the wind must have chilled him to the bone. 

But in Brady's usual understated manner, he just shrugged and said it was fun, except for one near collision with a clueless cow that had somehow escaped the pasture to stand in the middle of the road. But no big deal, right? At least the eyes he saw glowing in the darkness didn't belong to a bear.

The three of us crossed the state line together. Still no sign of Jeremiah. We caught up to him at a gas station and learned he had made it all the way the night before and slept under the state sign. The guys decided to take a siesta in the shade to wait out the hottest part of the day, but I pushed on, eager to finish up the last 30 miles to Richmond and be done.

That turned out to be a rather foolhardy decision. Hell's Canyon was just as hot as it sounded - The temperature dial was already pushing 100 before noon, and we were told that the canyon floor regularly reaches temperatures above 110 in the summertime.

I plodded along with the sun beating down on me, my mind as quiet as the desert landscape. I stopped frequently to guzzle from my overheated water bottle that offered hydration but no refreshment.

The climb out of the canyon was one of the worst ones ever. It was steep and endless, and I was heat-crazed and short on willpower. But I made it, and as always, coasting down the other side made the pain and frustration seem like a distant memory. The descent was just as steep as the climb had been, and the wind blasted my face like a hair dryer.

I arrived in the tiny town of Richland and went to the diner to enjoy some A/C and a milkshake. A lady who had dropped in to chat with the diner owner stopped by my table and asked, "How many cantaloupes can you carry on your bike?" I was stumped. "Uhh... I could probably fit two?" I answered. She scurried away then came back with two big cantaloupes. She said she had bought a bunch from a farm down the road and was apparently happy to share.

She told me I had come to Richland on a good day - That evening the town was having a homemade ice cream social at the park, which coincidentally was where we planned to camp that night. The park was full of pickup trucks and farmers in cowboy hats with their families. A group of elderly musicians played "Meet Me in St. Louis" on the bandstand.

#### Richland, OR to Baker City, OR (42 mi)

We decided to do a short ride to Baker City, the biggest town we had been through since Missoula, and spend the rest of the day relaxing there. It was approaching a week since our last shower, so we felt justified in our plan to treat ourselves to a motel there.

The day was hotter than ever, making 42 miles feel like far more. So far Oregon had been nothing but desert, and the harsh, arid terrain was starting to wear me down. I had pictured Oregon as a lush green coastal oasis, but apparently I would have to wait for the western half of the state to see that Oregon.

Baker City was a welcome oasis in the desert and a good choice for our half rest day. We had lunch at a deli then checked out a city history museum, which also had an enormous precious stone collection. We checked into a cheap motel and commenced operation relaxation which included pool time, stupid tv shows, reading, and takeout chinese food.

#### Baker City, OR to Bates, OR (51 mi)

We hung out at the hotel all morning eating several rounds of continental breakfast and working on our blogs. At checkout time we decided it wasn't worth it to start our ride during the hottest part of the day, so we planned to delay our departure until late afternoon even if it meant riding into the night again.

We migrated to the town's (fantastic) library to spend more time reading and writing and then checked out a local bookstore. It was really nice to be traveling with people who share my love of books.

Finally at 4:00 we felt we should finally leave town for the 50 mile ride we had planned. At that point we would definitely be riding well past dark. We had a headwind and overcast skies that threatened rain, but that was all preferable to sweltering heat. We got over two major climbs then found ourselves riding through peaceful pastures, the sky tinted pink by the setting sun.

Twilight seemed like the most beautiful time of day for a ride, and I wondered why I hadn't done it before. After the sun went down, though, the riding was much less pleasant. I was riding alone, two of the guys far ahead and the other far behind, with nothing but my bike light. I had about eight miles to go to the campsite where we planned to stop. I was getting spooked and couldn't wait for it to be over.

Finally I made it to the turnoff to the campsite and found Jeremiah and Ryan waiting. It was such a relief to be somewhere. We found our way to the hiker/biker site. Brady arrived shortly after and told us his front bike light had died. He had ridden the whole thing by starlight. I was so relieved we had all made it there in one piece and made up my mind not to do any more nighttime riding.

#### Bates, OR to Dayville, OR (61 mi)

A pretty uneventful day. It was still hot as hell, but the majority of the day was downhill riding, making for a relatively easy 60 miles. The town of Dayville was welcoming and refreshingly spunky. It was apparently situated near a fossil canyon we would be riding through tomorrow.

The Presbyterian church in Dayville has been hosting cyclists since the 1970s. When we arrived there was a couple on a bike tour with their 2-year-old daughter. The lucky child was not only getting early exposure to adventure but was also destined to be bilingual. Her Colombian mother and American father attentively spoke to her in equally fluent Spanish and English. 

That evening a lightning strike ignited a forest fire up on a mountain above Dayville. We watched as the flames spread and consume most of the mountain. We saw a fleet of fire trucks rushing out of town, and before long the fire looked like it was under control.
