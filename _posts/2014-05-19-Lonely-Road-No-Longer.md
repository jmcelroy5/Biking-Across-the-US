On the day I left Joe's hostel in Catawba, I was huffing and puffing up a hill when suddenly another cyclist on a fully-loaded bike appeared beside me, followed by three guys on road bikes with no gear. He asked where I was headed, and when I said Oregon he said he was too! I was so thrilled. Except for my very first day when I passed up a group of three older ladies, he was the first TransAmerican cyclist I had come across.

His name was Tuan, and it was actually his first day of riding, since he had started his trip from Blacksburg, VA. He's a Virginia Tech alum who left a job in software engineering to bike across the US. As we biked and talked it became clear I had met a like-minded soul, and we would get along very well.

The three other guys were his friends from Blacksburg who were accompanying him for the first 40 miles to send him off on the journey.

One of the guys is actually moving to San Francisco this summer for a job. Another guy has been wanting to do the TransAm (and actually gave Tuan the idea), but the bike he's building for it is still incomplete and he felt too mired down at work to get away this year. I encouraged him to make it happen in 2015! Well, hopefully he found it encouraging and not just annoying. haha

I felt so reinvigorated by having company that the ride felt easier and the miles flew by. It was nice to not have to worry about navigating and to have people to talk to during water and snack breaks.

Tuan's bike was a bit more heavily loaded than mine, with lots of gadgets and various loose items attached somewhat precariously to the outside of his bags:

He was lucky to have friends to help him on his inaugural ride, because things kept flying off! His coffee mug dropped in the middle of a highway, a clothesline he had wound around his handlebars nearly got tangled in his wheels, and his wallet fell out of his pocket without him noticing. It was a good exercise in refining his packing system, though, and by day two he had it all worked out.

Eventually Tuan's friends turned back toward Blackburg, and the two of us pressed on, passing through small towns and Virginia's beautiful pastoral landscapes. After biking for a week, I had started to take the scenery for granted, but riding with Tuan made me view it with fresh eyes. 

We were aiming to make it to a campground near a town called Max Meadows, which for me would make 60 miles for the day. As we approached the campground I noticed I was feeling a little irritable, which meant I was hungry. We stopped at a gas station just before the campground, and we both bought an armful of food that we took outside and ate sitting on the sidewalk. Gas station burritos are DELICIOUS when you're that hungry. I also indulged in a 400 calorie bottle of chocolate milk from a local dairy farm, a decadent treat I wouldn't allow myself in normal life.

After eating I felt reenergized. Tuan seemed to be feeling good too, riding high on the excitement of the first day. So we decided to pass up the campground and keep going to the next town, Wytheville, another 20 miles away, where we could camp at their park. 

About halfway we stopped at another gas station to refill our water bottles and look at our maps. Our maps routed us away from the feeder road where we had been riding, up a hill, through a small town, and then right back down to the highway to enter Wytheville. The hill looked daunting. 

The guy who worked as the gas station saw us looking at our maps and phones and said, "You don't wanna go up that hill. A lotta blind curves and a lotta rednecks up thur." He said we could save 5 miles and avoid the hill by continuing along the feeder road. So that was a no-brainer!

Taking the feeder road demonstrated why the TransAmerica maps we're following do not take the most direct East to West route, instead avoiding the major highways and cities and routing you along small local country roads. The shortcut we took wasn't terribly unpleasant, but it was just flat and monotonous riding alongside a busy freeway. It made me appreciate even more all the work and research that the Adventure Cycling Association put into choosing the best route!

We made it to Wytheville, a really charming and historic town. Their park was lovely, with strings of lights lighting the pathways. We claimed a corner of a deck for our sleeping area then fired up my little alcohol stove and cooked a second dinner of mac and cheese with beef jerky. So good.

While we were cooking dinner, a guy with eccentric mannerisms approached us, asked for a light, and then began mumbling something about just getting out of jail. He used our lighter for his cigarette then laid down on a picnic table. 

I felt uneasy about going to sleep with him nearby. I put my leatherman and pepper spray near my sleeping bag, though I felt guilty and conflicted for typecasting him that way. It was comforting to have Tuan there, though, and I was so exhausted I slept like a rock. The man was still there when we woke up in the morning, but he never bothered us. He just needed a place to sleep, too.

The next day Tuan and I rode 60 miles along more rolling country hills and a few mountain ascents that were long but mercifully gradual. As we approached Damascus, our destination, we opted to take a slightly longer alternate route along the Virginia  Creeper Trail, named after the creeper vines. The path was made of crushed cinder and gravel, so we had to take it slow, but the lush, shady creekside scenery and the break from riding with traffic was well worth the detour:

Damascus owes its existence to the many trails that run through it and proudly calls itself "The friendliest trail town." It's the crossroads of the TransAmerica Trail, the Virginia Creeper Trail, the Appalachian Trail, plus many other hiking/biking trails, and it's the gateway to the Mount Rogers wilderness. It's a small town, but it's a paradise for weary hikers and bikers.

We had dinner and beers at a great cheesesteak restaurant and then went to find The Place, a donation-based hiker/biker hostel run by a Methodist church. We received a warm welcome from Roy, who showed us to a spot in their yard reserved for TransAm cyclists. He explained that the hostel was originally established for cyclists but there weren't enough to sustain it, so they opened up to "dirty hikers" too. 

I took a glorious shower, scraping off layers of sunscreen, bike grease, and road grime off my legs. Then I plopped down on the hostel couches and made conversation with some of the hikers. A lot of them were there for the upcoming Trail Days, a weekend where Appalachian Trail thru-hikers past and present descend upon Damascus for a big celebration. 

We were lucky to get there during the calm before the storm. That weekend the town would blow up from its normal population of 1,000 to 10,000 or more. We were told that every spare patch of grass in town would be covered by tents and there would be "tent cities" erected on the edges of town which would become hotbeds of revelry and debauchery.

I had been riding for 6 days straight and was starting to feel a little run-down, so I decided to take a rest day in Damascus. It was a great place for it. I spent the morning working on my blog at a coffeeshop (the first one I'd seen since Charlottesville), did my laundry, bought some fuel for my camp stove, went to a taco place for dinner, and then putzed around the hostel talking to hikers. This is Dan, a hiker friend I made who is keeping a [blog](http://thejourneytotherock.blogspot.com) about his AT experience.

Tuan was still fresh, so he contined onward that day. I got an email from him in the evening saying he had reached Elkhorn City in Kentucky! He had done a nearly 90 mile ride over tough Appalachian terrain. I couldn't believe it. I thought I'd never catch up.
