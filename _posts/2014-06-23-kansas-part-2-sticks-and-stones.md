####Newton, KS to Nickerson, KS (50 miles) 

We spent all morning talking to James at the Newton Bike Shop, enthralled by his stories. He told us about his plans to expand into a full-blown cyclists' hostel with a restaurant and bar. Despite their bike shop's success and popularity in the community, they have met with an incredible amount of resistance from the town of Newton. 

It seems like lunacy for a town to push back on such a golden economic development opportunity, but apparently you cannot count on small town politicians to recognize a forward-thinking idea even if it lands in their laps. 

Frustrated with the road blocks they kept hitting, James and Heather have decided to take their idea to Ordway, Colorado, another town further along the route. I bet within a few years' time, Ordway will be known as the best stop on the TransAmerican Trail.

James and Heather are also involved with an amazing-sounding bike touring app in the works at Google that could completely supplant the paper route maps we have been following. The Google bike team had visited the shop just days before as they made their way across the US with their 360 degree cameras gathering information about bike routes. Dream job!

The ACA map routes you along side road 96 all the way from central Kansas to central Colorado. James recommended we take US 50 instead, saying that the few towns we would find on SR96, which may have been thriving when the route was first charted in 1976, are little more than ghost towns now. On US 50, he said, we would have a wide shoulder the whole way and could count on finding services and civilization at much more regular intervals. And since 96 more or less parallels 50, we could always get back on the ACA route if we changed our minds.

Tuan and I debated this for a while. It threw us for a loop, since we had never questioned the sanctity of the ACA route before. We decided we should get a taste of US 50 before committing, so we planned to ride it to the next town before getting on 96. 

Our conclusion was that it was nice to have the wide shoulder, but it was also a minefield of road debris and a flat tire waiting to happen. Also, the highway traffic was noisy and we found ourselves missing the peaceful backroads. What did it for us, though, was deciding we wanted to stick to the classical route 76. Even if it's less inhabited we wanted the full experience, and we wanted to run into other TransAmerican cyclists, too. 

Our off-route jaunt on US50 took us through a town called Hutchinson, where we saw a scary-looking maximum security prison and found another all-you-can-eat buffet. All very American. For $8.50 we stuffed ourselves beyond belief and had to take a siesta before continuing our ride. 

On the ride to the next town, we thought we were hallucinating when we came upon pastures full of zebras and ostriches. It turned out they belonged to a kitschy, overpriced B&B with wildlife tours. We stayed for a while walking around the property and taking pictures of the animals. In the back they had mountain goats, camels, and even giraffes. It was sad to see how the animals were kept in such confined spaces and deplorable, muddy conditions.

We continued on and found a Methodist church that looked like it might be a good place to camp. We saw a lady washing the glass doors and went up to ask if it would be ok to pitch our tents behind the building. To our surprise, she invited us to camp in her backyard instead. We waited around until she was finished cleaning and locking up the church, and then she gave us directions so we could meet her at her house. 

What seemed like a promising night turned into an embarrassing mishap. The directions had seemed fairly straightforward, but we got confused on the way and weren't sure which house was hers or if we were even on the right street. We waited at the turn into her neighborhood, expecting to see her car come by, but after sitting there for an hour we knew we must have missed her. 

Finally we cut our losses and scoped out a place to stealth camp. Being a weekend, we decided on a shadowy corner of an elementary schoolyard where we were unlikely to be spotted. We rolled out our sleeping bags on a sidewalk and set our alarms so we could make sure we were out of there before anyone would notice.

####Nickerson to Larned (60 miles)

The lady from the night before had mentioned she worked at a cafe, so the next morning we went looking for her, hoping to express our regret for the miscommunication. It turned out to be an easy enough task, since there was only one cafe in town. We enjoyed a big, hearty breakfast and the chance to learn more about the kind stranger from the church. Her name was Michelle and she had just moved to Kansas from California months before.

The ride that day was remarkably uninteresting. I tried to quiet my thoughts and enter a zen state as I watched the endless corn fields roll by, but after so many miles of unchanging scenery I was getting restless. There were few cars on the country road, so I started listening to A People's History of the United States on audiobook to pass the time.

Our final destination for the night, a town called Larned (pronounced Larn-id) announced itself with the pungent smell of cow manure, courtesy of a massive cattle feed yard. You couldn't get away from the smell in the town, but I guess the people who live there have just gotten used to it. 

As always, the first stop was the grocery store then the town park. We bought stuff to make bagel sandwiches with turkey, avocado, and tomato. Easy, fresh, and delicious! I think we found the perfect bike touring meal.

I was fast asleep in my tent by 10:00, but around 2:00 am I woke to the sound of something hitting my tent. I heard male voices nearby, then I saw something hit the side of my tent followed shortly by another one. It took me a second to register that they were rocks! I couldn't see what was going on, but I heard boys cursing and talking smack to each other and the sound of rocks hitting other things. Then a female voice cried out "Call the police!" I thought I was imagining it, but then she said it again, "Someone call the police!" 

At this point my heart was pounding wildly. Fortunately I still had the number for the local police on my recent call list, since we had had to register with them to camp in the park. By the time the police arrived the commotion had died down, and all the troublemakers had fled. The policemen swept the surrounding streets but didn't find anyone. Falling back asleep was difficult. Before I finally drifted off I had resolved in my mind to avoid camping in town parks. Teenage boredom in small towns is a real hazard.
