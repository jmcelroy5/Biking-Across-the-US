####Portland, OR to Seaside, OR

The Wisconsin boys and I had parted ways after Portland. They were eager to get down to the redwood forests in Northern California before Brady had to go back home to start a job. I stayed in Portland longer to meet Fiona, who was flying up from San Francisco to visit me for the weekend. 

It was so fun to see Fiona and catch up on life. We rented a room on airbnb, complete with a kale garden, chicken coop, and a hostess who was into the local bike activism scene. Fiona and I made it our weekend mission to do all the Portland-y things we could. We shopped at craft fairs, waited in line for brunch, waited in line for tacos, saw a movie at a brewpub theater, and biked across bridges.

After seeing Fiona off, I charted my own route from Portland to the coast, relying heavily on Google for navigation. It took an entire afternoon just to get out of Portland. The city has an urban growth boundary, which prevents it from expanding into surrounding farmland, but it was still the biggest, most metropolitan area I had biked through. At least, being Portland, there were plenty of good bike routes that kept me off the freeways. 

My route to the coast incorporated a beautiful 30-mile foresty bike path from Banks, OR to Vernonia, OR. It was incredible to be completely off the road for such a long stretch. Even better that the path was lined with thickets of delicious wild blackberries!

After two days of riding by myself from Portland through rural Oregon, I reached Astoria, the final town on the TransAmerican Trail. Though Astoria has historical significance as the western end of Lewis & Clark's expedition, it's kind of an anti-climactic end to a bicycle journey. Astoria sits not on the ocean but more inland near the mouth of the Columbia River. 

After Astoria, I pointed my tires south and began to bike down the coast. I made it to Seaside, OR that night, where I had my first brush with the Pacific Ocean. Even though I was exhausted from a 100-mile day, I pushed my bike down the sandy beach and dipped my wheels in the water. It was a satisfying way to commemorate the end of a journey.

That night I treated myself to a hostel in Seaside. It was a cozy, welcoming place, and I met a lot of cool female travelers.

Two days later I ran into Jeremiah in Tillamook. The weather was dreary and drizzly, so he had opted for a partial rest day to work on their blog while Brady and Ryan went ahead. I saw him walking out of the library just as I was leaving town, and he joined me for the last twenty miles of the day.

It turned out that between Brady and Ryan's fast pace and a couple of setbacks on my part (a sick day and a bike breakdown), Jeremiah and I wouldn't catch them until Eureka, CA. So for most of the Oregon coast and much of Northern California, it was just us. We made an interesting travel duo, because we represent two extremes of personality - I am almost OCD in my planning, whereas Jeremiah prefers just riding without knowing where he'll end up that night. I tried to take a page from his book and relax in the uncertainty sometimes.
