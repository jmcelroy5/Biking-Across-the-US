####Larned to Ness City (60 miles) 

This was the most difficult day of the entire trip. It was cold and rainy when we woke up, and it was forecasted to continue all day, I still felt unrested after a rocky night (heh, rocky) but staying in that smelly town any longer wasn't an option. I lethargically packed up my soaking wet tent, heated up some oatmeal, and went about preparing for the day. 

There were actually a few pleasant surprises that brightened up the morning. When we rolled out of the park we saw that the town was filled with bicycles. We went into a coffee shop where many of them were stopping to find out what was going on. It turned out to be a supported ride across Kansas with over 900 cyclists. Pretending to be part of the group, we got someone to take a picture in our matching rain gear.

On the way out of town we passed Fort Larned, a historic military outpost that was built to protect mail wagons on the Santa Fe trail from Native Americans. It was really neat to see how they had restored the rooms to their original appearance.

When we continued on, we had a a brutal wind coming from northeast. It would've been a bearable tail/cross wind if we had been traveling west as we normally do, but the route that day had us going north for a twenty mile stretch. The wind was blowing at 20-25 mph, and it slowed us down to an effortful crawl. We were moving at less than half our usual speed, and it drove me crazy thinking about how I could jog faster than that.

We finally made it to a town after the nearly 3 hour battle, where we were hoping to get a bite to eat and a break from the wind. We went up to a place with a Cafe sign out front, only to find out it had been converted into a liquor store. We then walked by an abandoned convenience store and checked out the only restaurant in town. The sign said it wouldn't be open until dinnertime. A little disappointed, we made do with the snacks we were carrying before pushing on to the next town.

At this point the route turned west, so we had been looking forward to having the wind at our backs. But no such luck! The wind had shifted  and was now blowing at our side, directly from the north. We had to lean to the right and brace ourselves to keep it from blowing our bikes into the traffic lane. The rain started coming down in cold, stinging pellets,

We were looking forward to the next town another 20 miles away, where the map indicated there would be a restaurant and a TransAm hostel called Bicycle Oasis. When we finally got there we found that the gas station was closed, and the diner looked like it hadn't been open for years. We found the hostel and knocked on the door. The lights were off and all doors were locked. 

By this time the wind was so ferocious, even walking in it took effort. There was nowhere to take shelter, so we solemnly pushed on to the next town, Ness City, 11 miles away.

Riding in the rain and wind was beginning to feel dangerous. We were struggling to keep our bikes straight, and one time a particularly strong gust of wind pushed my bike clear across the traffic lane, just as a semi truck with an oversized load was approaching in the opposite lane. I had to dismount to regain control.

We came upon a rest area, where we met two Austrian bike tourers who were also seeking shelter from the wind. They had had it for the day and were planning to set up camp there. It was at least some meager consolation to know that we weren't the only crazy cyclists out braving the weather.

Strangely, even as the weather worsened, I had a breakthrough in my mood. To get my mind off the roar of the wind and our slow progress I started focusing on the little details in the scenery - the play of light, the grass whipping around, the clouds moving quickly across the sky, the interactions between cows. I tried to stop fighting the wind and just accept it as a constant. 

We finally made it to Ness City and had no qualms about checking into a motel for the night. The Derrick Inn turned out to be the *real* bicycle oasis. There was a hamburger shack next door, so we got double cheeseburgers, fries, ice cream, and beer. We luxuriated in eating our dinner in front of the tv and then soaking our weary muscles in the hotel's hot tub.

To our pleasant surprise, all of our friends we had met back in Pittsburg - Mike, Terry, Paul, John, and Jonathan - were staying at the hotel, too. Commiseration and camaraderie was the best way to end the day.

####Ness City to Leoti (80 miles)

The next day was a million times better. The storm had passed over us and given way to blue skies, cool temperatures, and just a light breeze. It was the first time we had seen the sun for days, and the vitamin D worked wonders for my state of mind. We stopped at a cute coffeeshop before heading out of Ness City and had some delicious homemade fruit cobbler for breakfast.

The day passed by serenely. Without a headwind, covering eighty miles took less time and felt far easier than the sixty miles we rode the day before. I listened to an energetic punk rock playlist and put more energy into my shoulder dancing and head bopping than pedaling. 

At one point we came across a graveyard of farm machinery, some really sad-looking cows in a feed yard, and the first windmills we had seen on the whole trip. I don't know why Kansas isn't covered in windmills instead of all the little oil rigs we saw. Harnessing all the wind in Kansas could probably power the whole country!

In Leoti we had dinner at a Mexican restaurant then headed over to the town park. We were surprised to meet two new cyclists there, Esther and Warren, from Germany and England. I had actually come across their [blog](http://estherwarren.wordpress.com) before I left for my trip.

They call Scotland home, but they have been biking around the word for the past FOUR years! They were so full of stories from their adventures and so wonderful to talk to. There was still sunlight until nearly 10:00 pm that night, so we lost track of time before tiredness finally overcame us.

Except for one man who had snuck off to the park to have a late-night phone conversation with his (secret?) lover, our rest was blissfully undisturbed that night.
