When I look back on biking through Kentucky, what I am more likely to remember than the dog attacks or the coal trucks will be the warm hospitality of my hosts at the various places I stayed. Southern hospitality is no myth, and it amazed and humbled me over and over again.

In Eastern Kentucky I got a lot of bad weather. At two different diners where I had stopped to wait out the storms, I was offered coffee on the house by the waitresses. At one diner, the lady handed me the remote to their TV and said I was welcome to stay as long as I wanted. 

The long, difficult days on the road were always soothed over when I arrived at my destination for the night. Everywhere I stayed, my hosts took me in and seemed to have a genuine attitude of "mi casa es tu casa." 

####Lookout, KY: The Freeda Harris Baptist Center

On my first night I stayed at a Baptist Center, which was marked on the ACA map as a place that hosts cross-country cyclists. I couldn't get cell service to call ahead and let them know I was coming, so I just hung out outside the building, hoping someone would show up but planning to camp on the side of the building if they didn't. 
	
Within minutes of arriving, a local man stopped by and assured me that the family who runs the place had just gone out to run errands and would be back soon. That eased my mind and made the wait much more bearable. When Alice arrived and let me in she showed me around the facilities, which included a bathroom and a fully-stocked kitchen where I was left to use anything I wanted to cook dinner. A happy ending to a rough first day in Kentucky!

####Hindman, KY: The Knott Historical Society 

The next night I stayed at the Knott County Historical Society, which was actually someone's home that had also become a hostel exclusively for cyclists. My host, Dave, greeted my arrival with an iced tea, offered to do my laundry, introduced me to his many cats, showed me where the shower was, and said dinner would be ready in an hour. I thought I was in heaven!

Later he brought out an incredibly elaborate dinner. Even with my ravenous appetite after a long, hilly day I couldn't finish it all. This was followed by the most epic ice cream sundae I've ever seen and an equally elaborate breakfast in the morning. He really pulled out all the stops, and he does this for every cyclist who stays with him, even when he receives larger touring groups. He only requests $25 from each guest, so he must not be profiting from this operation. It's just an incredible display of goodness and generosity.

Dave was also fantastic company. As a native Kentuckian and a historical writer, he was a fount of fascinating local knowledge, and I was entertained by his stories of cyclists he's hosted. We especially bonded over our love of cats. This is him with his five-fingered cat, Edgar Allan Toe:

#### Booneville, KY: Booneville Presbyterian Church

After a challenging 70 mile day, I ended up at the Presbyterian church in Booneville, which allows cyclists to camp behind it. I got there just before the sun went down, and there was no one else there, but this welcoming sign made me feel comfortable just waltzing in and pitching my tent:

They had a lovely area in the back with a well-tended lawn for camping, a shelter with picnic tables, a shower room, and a port-a-potty. There was a note to cyclists next to the shower room, which started by saying "This may not be the Ritz Carlton," but it may as well have been! It meant a lot that a small church would provide such facilities to long-distance cyclists. When you're on the road, it feels amazing to arrive anywhere that makes you feel at home for the night.

#### Berea, KY: Couchsurfing hosts

I had been looking forward to Berea, a cute college town that marked the end of the Appalachians and the promise of good coffeeshops. 

There was no camping marked there on the map, so I sent some last-minute Couchsurfing requests. I heard back from a girl named Brittany who said I could stay with her and her boyfriend. Even though they were busy planning for their wedding and honeymoon which were coming up in just a few weeks, they were willing to host me! I had a great time talking to them and swapping travel stories.

Tuan had arrived in Berea a few days ahead of me and decided to take a few rest days there. When I got into town he and I met for dinner at a Mexican restaurant and recounted our Eastern Kentucky experiences. When he had arrived in Berea he had no plans for where to stay, but then he had met a guy in a cafe who invited him to camp in his yard and to help him train his dog in search and rescue during the day.

#### Hudson, KY: The Double L Grocery Store 

Tuan and I rode on together from Berea. The first night we stayed at a campground, and then the second day we pulled an exceptionally long day (83 miles, including an accidental detour) in order to make it to an intriguing stopover on the TransAmerica map, a grocery store that allows cyclists to camp outside it.

When we showed up at the Double L grocery store, it looked dark and closed from the outside. The wraparound patio was covered in an eclectic mix of furniture and knickknacks piled on top of each other, making us wonder if the shop might actually be closed permanently. As we were scratching our heads, wondering if it'd be ok to camp outside it anyway, a mom and a daughter walked up and said they were the owners. Their names were Lucy and Lauren, which is where the Double L name came from.

Not only did they allow us to camp under their patio roof and warn us about the storm forecasted for that night, they also invited us to join their family for dinner! We signed their cyclist guestbook, and they regaled us with stories of cyclists they had met over the years. Lucy and Lauren had really sweet spirits and joyfulness about them. I especially loved how Lucy started any sentence about herself with "I'm very privileged and blessed [to have a daughter, have grown up in Kentucky, to have travelled, etc.]"

That night was surreal. From the porch of that little unassuming shop in the middle of nowhere I saw some of the most stunning natural phenomena of my life. We watched the sun set in a dome-like sky that seemed even bigger than it ever had anywhere else. As it grew darker we could see lightning flash in the distance and heard the thunder that announced the storm's arrival. All around the store we saw the twinkling of fireflies. I retired to my tent for the night and woke up several times to the sound of rain pelleting my tent. Nature! It's so amazing and powerful.

#### Utica, KY: Volunteer Fire Station

The next day we pulled another long day to get to Utica, where we knew there was a fire station with camping for cyclists. What we didn't realize was that we'd have full access to the fire station. When we pulled into town someone came out of the station and waved us down. It was another cyclist, who was traveling west to east. He had been told that there was an open-door policy for cyclists - We could just walk right into the fire station and make ourselves at home! Several firefighters stopped by to say hello and chat with us, but fortunately there weren't any emergencies during the night, so we got a solid night's sleep on the couches there. The next morning we took advantage of having use of a kitchen to make a big breakfast of eggs, bacon, and toast. 

#### Sebree, KY: First Baptist Church

This was probably my favorite stopover of all. When we left Utica, we called ahead to the First Baptist Church in Sebree that was on the TransAm map. We expected they would let us camp or sleep on the floor, but we couldn't have anticipated what would actually happen.

We were greeted by the church pastor, Bob, and his wife, Violet, who live in a house on church property. They gave us ice cream sandwiches and showed us to their youth center where we could sleep (on real beds!) and shower. They had a huge wall map where cyclists could pin where they're from, and they also gave us a sheet with incredibly useful information about lodging and points of interest that lay ahead of us on our route the next day.

After we had gotten settled and freshened up, Violet invited us back to their house for a delicious home-cooked dinner. Violet was the most delightful company and one of the warmest people I have ever met. She entertained us endlessly with colorful stories of cyclists they have hosted over the decades. She seemed genuinely curious about our stories and happy to have us there, despite the fact that she probably feeds and entertains dozens of cyclists every year.

Bob and Violet sort of accidentally became TransAmericanTrail angels. Way back in the early 80s when Bob started pastoring at that church, they didn't know that it was located directly on the route. They realized it when cyclists began regularly appearing at their door asking for water, because the designated camping area in the town park down the road often didn't have it. Violet started offering the cyclists meals or even invited them to sleep on their couch. Gradually word got out among cross-country cyclists, and eventually the ACA marked the church on the TransAm map as cyclist lodging without even consulting Bob and Violet! 

But they saw it as their ministry, and they have been happy to continue assuming that role. When the church built a new youth center Bob asked them if they wouldn't mind sharing the space, and now it's officially a refuge for cyclists. The service they provide seems to dovetail nicely with the church's mission, since it gives them an opportunity to share their faith with people who find themselves in a time of transition. Bob made the insightful observation that most long-distance cyclists are seeking a greater truth. People generally don't just decide to bike across the country unless they're at least somewhat discontented.

I think it's common for people to want to help others or be hospitable on their own terms (when it's convenient for them), but Bob and Violet made me realize what an even deeper level of service looks like. No matter the day of the week or what personal plans they have made, they will take in any passing cyclist at a moment's notice and make sure they are housed and fed. It amazes me that they would so unconditionally and warmly open their private home and family time to total strangers! Just as the family at the Double L Grocery and David at the cyclists' hostel did as well.

 As we were eating dessert and Violet was showing us pictures and newspaper clippings of past cyclists she hosted, Bob suddenly said, "Hey! I almost forgot it's country western night." Before we knew it we we had all piled into their car and were on our way to the town community center, where every Friday night a group of elderly people gets together to play country music and dance two-step. 

I felt like a lucky lady when several men there asked me to dance! Fortunately I at least knew the basic step, so I was able to follow along well enough. I thought was so neat that the town had created a space and a regular event for older people to socialize and exercise. In most places there is a lack of entertainment geared toward that age group, which I see as a failing of our communities and a sign of ageism in our society.

The first man I danced with said he was 87. When he stood up from his chair to invite me onto the dance floor he had stumbled and grabbed onto the wall. I was nervous he would fall, but he was a smooth dancer! Violet said that he sometimes comes in on a walker, but when he dances he's steady. Remarkable.

When I asked Violet if she dances herself, she responded spunkily "Well, some people say dancing is a sin, but I think it all depends on how you dance!" She said she enjoys it, but as a Baptist pastor's wife she would never dance in public. But she said that she tells Bob as soon as he retires they're going dancing! 

#### The (Bad) Dog Days Are Over 

Ever since Tuan and I rode away from Berea, we have not had any more problems with dogs. Not that we haven't had some bark at us, but now that we're out of the Appalachians and into rolling farmlands the dogs we see are far more docile and better trained. It's so strange that we even see some of the very same breeds of dogs that tried to eat our legs in Eastern Kentucky, but over here they just watch us roll on by! 

We even made some new friends. These cute little guys took a special liking to us and actually followed (not chased) our bikes for almost a mile! I was worried they wouldn't be able to find their way back home, but Tuan assured me that country dogs have a good sense of direction.
