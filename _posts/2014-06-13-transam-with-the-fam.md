####Hartville, MO to Everton, MO (85 mi)

My wonderful parents drove 11 hours from Houston to meet me in the middle of nowhere, Missouri to join me on the trail for a few days. They found me and Tuan early in the morning in Hartville where we were camping on the courthouse lawn. 

We went to the local diner, where we got hearty breakfasts for $5, and my parents were quickly immersed in the culture of small town USA. The weather-worn local men had all gathered there for their social hour, and the waitress flirted as she refilled their bottomless coffee. When I saw my mom's nose wrinkle I remembered that smoking in restaurants is still allowed in these parts. 

We had a particularly long ride planned for that day, because there were no towns with non-camping accommodations for the next 80 miles. We were aiming for Everton, MO, where the four of us could stay at Running Spring Farm, a hunting lodge that serves as cyclist lodging during the summer months. 

80 miles is a long day even for me and Tuan, so I gave my dad the option of meeting us further down the road to make his ride a more reasonable distance. But he said he wanted the challenge and bravely insisted on doing the full ride. Not that I was worried about him at all. He once rode the MS 150 with no prior training, and that was even before he became a crazy marathon runner!

He had just bought a new bike for a great price on Craigslist. I whole-heartedly approved of his choice, because it was a Jamis just like mine. The model I have is called the Aurora (an all-steel touring machine) and his is the Satellite (similar specs but with a little sportier with carbon fiber forks). 

As we were getting ready to head out after breakfast, my parents got a Skype call from John. It was nice to have the whole family "together" for a brief moment and to see my nephew, who's now toddling around like a champ and getting into all kinds of trouble.

My mom took our panniers from us and very graciously served as our sag wagon for the day, giving Tuan and I a glorious break from riding fully-loaded. I had almost forgotten what it felt like to ride with a "naked" bike! It took a few wobbly minutes to get used to it, and then we were flying. 

The beginning of the ride was net downhill along a calm road with more beautiful Missouri countryside. Our spirits were high as we flew along, easily averaging 15-20 mph. My dad seemed to really be enjoying his new road bike. I remember the first time I tried riding a road bike I was amazed at how fast and smooth it was.

After about 25 miles we passed through Marshfield, where my parents had stayed at a Holiday Inn the night before. It was right on the route, so we stopped by to say hi to my mom and refuel with coffee, bananas, and other snacks she had brought. I tell ya, the best hospitality in Missouri.

The rest of the ride was pleasant but hilly. I felt bad for my dad, because his bike didn't have as many gears as ours, so the hills were even more of a battle. Also it turned out his shifter was broken, so he couldn't get into his highest gear to gain momentum for the hills. Still, he toughed it out.

Around mile 60 our energy was flagging. Gatorade, Snickers, and a rest at a gas station deli fortified us for the final push of the day. I felt a little bad about patronizing that place later, though, when Tuan showed me this picture he had taken there. It's so messed up I thought it had to be a joke!

A bit later we had a run-in with a pack of mean dogs. My dad got off to walk his bike, and the alpha dog, some kind of pit bull mix, tried to get around and at his legs. When he came to bark at me I was ready with the pepper spray. I got him in the nose, and though I missed my target, it was enough to get him to back off until we got away. I was amazed that the first time I actually had to use the pepper spray wasn't in Eastern Kentucky but in Missouri where we had relatively few dog encounters.

Later I must have been getting weary and distracted, because I didn't notice when Tuan and my dad suddenly slowed down in front of me. I ran into my dad's back wheel and crashed, hitting my head (well, fortunately my helmet) on the ground and scraping up my elbow. 
 
We finally got to Everton and had to ride a mile and a half down a gravel road. When we got to the lodge we were completely spent, but we couldn't have ended at a better place. There were comfy couches, real beds, hot showers, and beer in the fridge. And best of all, my mom had a dinner of lasagna, salad, and garlic bread waiting for us! 

Two Eastbound cyclists, photographers from San Diego, were staying there also. Their names were Vic and Tor (seriously). We exchanged tons of information about lodging. We warned them about the rabid dogs in Eastern Kentucky, and they told us about the curious cows in Kansas.

My dad was the one who taught me to ride a bike and taught me to love riding as I grew up. Throughout my childhood we'd go on long rides along the bayou trails in Houston, and sometimes we'd bike all the way to my grandmother's house. 

When I was about 10 he took me on a 50 mile group ride in Louisiana. I don't think I had ever ridden more than 20 miles at a time before that, so the ride was a struggle for me. 

I distinctly remember going into a strong headwind for the entire second half of the ride and swearing I would never ever bike again once it was over! I told this story over dinner at the lodge, and my dad was surprised to learn that he had almost ruined cycling for me on that one occasion. But clearly I must've gotten over it. :)

####Everton, MO to Pittsburg, KS (60 miles)

The next day's ride was much less daunting. Only the first fifteen miles were hilly, and then the landscape would flatten out like a pancake as we approached the Kansas border and the Great Plains. Here is my dad tackling one of the last of the monster hills:

Also, there was a famous diner called Cooky's Cafe after 30 miles, reputedly one of the best on the TransAmerican Trail. I rushed us through the first part of the ride, anxious to get there before they closed at 1:00. But of course, there's always time for a turtle rescue, even when pie is on the line. These fellas are suicidal! We've probably rescued dozens of them, though sadly we see more squished turtles than live ones.

We made it just in time and had the most decadent meal of my entire trip: fried chicken and lots of sides followed by a big slice of Dutch blueberry crumble pie. I needed to be rolled out of there.

The restaurant is such a regular stop for TransAm cyclists that they even had a guestbook, which I would venture to guess might be one of the most comprehensive! No hungry cyclist can pass up homemade pie. We saw names we recognized of cyclists we had been trailing for a while and a few Eastbounders we had come across in the past several days.

The second half of the ride was much more relaxed, which was good, because I was so achingly stuffed from lunch I could only pedal in slow motion anyway. 

Western Missouri gave us a taste of what Kansas would be like. The rolling hills flattened out, trees became sparse, and the fields went out as far as the eye could see. We could see towns coming from as far as 8 miles away when their water towers came into view on the horizon. A lot of cyclists look forward to the flat riding in Kansas, but I found myself dreading the featureless scenery and the long uninhabited stretches. But it was a mental battle I had been anticipating ever since I decided to do this trip.

When we made it to Pittsburg, our first major town in Kansas and our destination for the night, we met my mom at the Holiday Inn and went out to dinner at a local steakhouse. The next morning was breakfast at the hotel and saying goodbye to my parents who had a long day of driving ahead of them.

i feel really lucky that my parents have been supportive of this bike trip from the beginning. It may have been out of their comfort zone initially, but I think they worry about me less now that they've been able to see the reality of life on the road. I was really glad they could be a part of it for a few days and see why I love doing this so much.

####Pittsburg, KS (0 miles)

Tuan and I decided to take a rest day in Kansas. We made a trip to the post office, shopped for some new biking shirts, and then spent all afternoon at the local bikeshop, Tailwind Cyclery, getting my bike worked on. 

I had just taken my bike in to make sure that the way we had fixed the bent derailleur was going to be ok, but it turned out there were many more serious things wrong with it. The derailleur was installed improperly, the stem was loose, the gearing needed major adjustment, and the wheels were out of true. Yikes. 

Once the guy at the bike shop had finished with my bike (and burned a hole in my pocket) my bike rode like a dream machine! I didn't even realize there was anything wrong with it before, but it runs noticeably more smoothly and quietly now.

Resting in Pittsburg was a fortuitous decision, because a bunch of Westbound cyclists caught up with us. Our friend, Mike, who had taken a detour to meet his wife in Wichita, met us there, and then we also ran into a pair of men from Oregon (Jerry and Jonathan) and a pair of Brits (Paul and Terry). 

Mike, Paul, Terry, Tuan, and I all camped at the city park. We had a great time drinking summer shandy and shooting the breeze until well after dark
