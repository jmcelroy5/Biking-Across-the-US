####Madison to Ennis (85 mi)

Big Sky Country. Even after the wonders of Yellowstone I was enchanted by the vibrant blue sky and the glassy lakes with mountainous backdrops that greeted me in Montana. The first day started out easy breezy, downhill, and tailwindy. At one point I got off my bike to admire a mountain I had just cruised down. Right after I stopped to snap a picture, I heard a sharp popping noise and the sigh of air leaving my back tire. After covering 7 states and a couple thousand miles I had my first flat. It's a testament to the quality of Schwalbe Marathon tires that I had even made it that far with no incidents, but even the most flat resistant tires won't stand to the challenge of a jagged broken beer bottle. 

I've only changed a few flats in my life. For someone who decided to ride a bike a cross the country, I know shamefully little about bikes. So the whole trip I had been a little nervous for the inevitable day when I would have to change a tire on the side of the road. Luckily when that day came it wasn't too hot out, and I had plenty of daylight left. It turned out I only needed half an hour to get on my way again. I got the tire patched up and the wheel back on without a problem. It certainly didn't hurt that this was my view while changing it:

The town of Ennis, my destination for the night, was very good to me. I hit up a burger joint for dinner and then a had amazing locally made ice cream. 

I camped behind Willie's distillery in town, where they allow cyclists to stay. It's great of them to do that, but I got the sense that they were a little begrudging about it. On arrival they handed me a list of rules for cyclists that anyone with common courtesy wouldn't need to be reminded of. One rule requested that you keep the noise down so you don't bother the hotel guests next door, because "they are paying and deserve a good night's sleep." Hmph.

As it turned out, neither hotel guest nor bum cyclist would get a full night's sleep, thanks to a car alarm on Main Street that went off not once, not twice, but probably six or seven times between midnight and 4 am. 

####Ennis to Twin Bridges (40 mi)

Exhausted from a sleepless night, I wasn't in much of a mood to climb a mountain. It was a 10 mile ascent with more elevation gain than I had lost over the course of the whole previous downhill day. I was pretty unenthusiastic about it, but I decided to be patient with myself and take as many breaks as needed. 

A county sherrif stopped by on one of these breaks to make sure I was okay. I only had a few sips left in my water bottle, so he offered to refill them with ice cold water for me. It was such a nice gesture and pick-me-up, especially on a hot, low-motivation day.

I finally crested the pass then zoomed down into Virginia City, a wonderfully preserved historic town from the Gold Rush era. I had lunch at an old saloon then treated myself to some more homemade ice cream.

I just didn't feel into the riding that day, so I decided to cut the ride short at 40 miles to catch up on sleep and feel stronger for the next day. Seeing a storm up ahead made the decision even easier.
 
The tiny town of Twin Bridges was one of the most unexpectedly bike-friendly towns I've come across. They really roll out the red carpet for cyclists. A bike lane welcomed me to town, and I followed signs to a screened-in shelter (with shower!) in the town park made for touring cyclists to camp overnight.

Another cyclist was already there, a man from Colorado on a 2-week tour of Montana. Shortly after, another cyclist showed up, a senior in college biking the TransAm West to East. I was impressed by his frugal eating habits - He carried bags of food he had bought in bulk, and in the morning I envied his dinner of peanut butter banana tortillas with muesli and nuts.

As nice as it was to have company, sleep-deprivation won out over conversation, and I crashed at 8:30 pm. 

####Twin Bridges to Wisdom (92 mi)

The next morning got off to a promising start with a quad latte from a drive-through coffeeshop.

Because there weren't many cities within my normal riding distance, I decided to aim for a town called Wisdom over 90 miles and two intense mountain climbs away. One of the cyclists at Twin Bridges warned me that there was a major mosquito infestation in that town, and various other people I met throughout the day said it was a bad idea to stop there. I wasn't super thrilled about that, but I also take cautionary advice with a grain of salt. In the worst case I could take immediate refuge in my tent.

I knocked out the first 30 miles to the next town with ease and stopped at the grocery store there to stock up, knowing it would be the last one I'd see for over 100 miles. Past that town, I got the sense that my back tire (the one I'd patched up) was low, so I stopped to pump it up. It's hard to get the air pressure up with the little hand pump, so I pushed and pushed as hard as I could... until I heard a pop and a sigh that told me I'd blown out the patch. 

It didn't take long to change the tube, though, and I also lined the ripped segment of tire with a strip of a waxy FedEx envelope that one of the guys from the night before had given to me to help prevent future flats. Nice little trick to know.

I saw more Eastbound cyclists than usual, including two women traveling together. I see lots of couples bike touring, but females alone or riding solo is an uncommon sight. The ride was hot and barren, but stopping to talk to other cyclists helped keep my spirits up throughout my longest ride ever. The wind was blowing against me the majority of the day, and the two mountain climbs were pretty killer. It was so hot I went through both water bottles and my two liter platypus.

Approaching Wisdom, I kept feeling bugs hit my face with force. I got off my bike to find something to cover my face, and when I looked down at my legs I saw dozens of mosquitos swarming around. I stomped around to keep them from biting while I put on sunglasses and a shawl. When I got back on the bike I rode with my head angled downward. I could hear whole clouds of mosquitoes hitting my helmet. 

Not surprisingly, not a single soul could be seen outdoors in Wisdom. I was looking for an American Legion Park where I heard you could camp for free, but at this point I was feeling apprehensive about this plan. Once I got to the park I was overjoyed to find a screened-in shelter. I had never heard of the American Legion and had no idea what they're about, but I am very indebted to them!

Another cyclist was already there, a friendly fellow from Arizona biking the TransAm the other way. Clearly we were going to share the shelter, but he seemed apologetic about it, as if I might feel uncomfortable as a lone female staying in the same room with a strange man. I had to laugh at how this scenario has become pretty routine.

Really I was probably the one who should've been apologetic - I have never considered myself a particularly outgoing person, so I've been amazed at how chatty I get with strangers after I've been by myself for a while. I talked the poor guy's ears off like a little girl at a slumber party.

####Wisdom to Hamilton (75 mi)

The next morning I high-tailed it out of the mosquito farm town. The morning's ride took me through beautiful national forest land that made me wish I had pushed a little bit further the day before. Dispersed camping is allowed in national forests, and I saw several tents and RVs that had made their own little camps in cozy clearings just off the road. I vowed to be braver about camping in non-established campsites from now on, especially in national forestland where it's explicitly legal. 

There was another mountain to climb, but it turned out it wasn't as bad as it looked on the elevation profile. This was followed by the most epic descent of the entire trip. Flying along, singing out loud to Third Eye Blind, I probably didn't pedal a single stroke for over 10 miles. I only stopped a few times to let my rims cool off. 

On the way down I met a cyclist who I had been hearing about for days. His name was Joe, and he is in last place in the race across America. I doubt he ever intended to win, though, as he was weighted down with over 100 pounds of gear. But if it were a contest of who's having the most fun he's definitely in first place! He showed off his collection of junior ranger badges on his handlebar bag. He had been stopping to take tests at all the ranger stations to earn them. Before setting off again, he was eager to tip me off on the location of "secret" hot springs after Missoula.

My friend, Jeremy, was on his way to meet me in Missoula the next day for my side trip to Glacier National Park as part of his motorcycle tour through Canada and the Pacific Northwest. We had been texting about where to meet up in Missoula, but as I approached Hamilton, my destination for the day, I saw the name of the campground where he had said he was staying that night. It hadn't occurred to me that we'd be traveling down the same highway. I texted him again and invited him to stay with me in Hamilton instead, where I was going to camp at an RV park.

When he arrived at 9 pm I had set up camp and ordered a large pizza. Seeing him roll up on a motorcycle reminded me how long I had been gone. When I left San Francisco he was taking the course for his license and hadn't bought a motorcycle yet, but now he's cruising all over.

####Hamilton to Missoula (45 mi)

The next day was an easy 45 mile cruise along bike paths and a wide highway shoulder into Missoula. I stopped at a lemonade stand run by 3 little girls on the way into town. They were amazed how many of their little cups of lemonade I guzzled down. Nearly wiped 'em out!

During my 45 mile ride Jeremy had sped ahead of me and sent me enticing photos of latte art from Missoula. I joined him at the coffeeshop, and then we continued on to our accommodation the night. We stayed with a legendary warmshowers host named Bruce Anderson who lives near the University of Montana.

Bruce Anderson is a veritable Trail Angel. He sets a new definition of generosity, literally sharing his home with touring cyclists throughout the summer. He leaves the back door unlocked and even had a guide to their home written up to orient his guests. Basically the message is "mi casa es tu casa." He welcomes you to use his kitchen, shower, laundry room, and to pitch your tent in the yard or crash on his couches. Regarding length of stay, the guide says, "As long as you want, but if you're here more than a month we might start charging you rent ;)" 

When we got to Bruce's there were already several tents in the yard. The other guests were three Continental Divide cyclists, a French couple riding from Alaska to Florida, a German man who's been on the road for years, and two guys on the TransAm. One of the TransAm guys had apparently heard about me from some Eastbound cyclists who recommended he try to catch up to me. I'm flattered! 

Just as we were all winding down for bed, Bruce casually mentioned that his son's pet python had escaped from the cage and hadn't been found yet. "But don't worry, he's friendly!" he said, supposedly to reassure us. I had been planning to sleep on the floor inside, but that was enough to motivate me to pitch my tent.
