####Sheridan Lake to Ordway (88 miles)

The next morning we got a leisurely start, drinking coffee and chatting in the church kitchen. Tuan and I were last to leave, as always, and after about 15 miles he broke off to see a Native American massacre memorial site 8 miles off route. 

I caught up with the whole crew at a diner in the next town. They were just finishing brunch, so I got a quick bite to eat from the gas station so I could ride on with them. This may be the only time in my life when I can eat hot dogs and donuts for lunch with impunity, so I'm taking advantage of it. 

Before taking off, Paul and Terry introduced us to their other cycling companion they had brought along for photo ops and general entertainment:

On the way out of town, we found this great sign marking the halfway point of the TransAmerican Trail. It's hard to believe how far we've come!

Mike and I paired up for the rest of the ride. Traffic was light, so we hooked his speaker up to my iphone and jammed out all the way to Ordway. The landscape had turned to vast, uninhabited desert. Mike stopped to take a picture of a flower, and a little hummingbird showed up, making for some award-winning photos.

A truck coming the other way stopped to say hi and alert us that the Jesus caravan was coming. We kind of laughed, not really sure what that meant, until a few miles down the road when we saw a magnificently bearded elderly man driving a tractor with two caged doves in the back and "Jesus wept" written on the side. Really wish we could've heard this guy's story! (Photo by [Esther and Warren](http://estherwarren.blogspot.com/).)

At around mile 60 my energy took a nose-dive. Mike encouraged me onward with talk of of ice cream when we reached the next town, called Sugar City. Surely they'd have something sweet there. When we got there we found a cafe and settled on pie instead. 

We found Esther and Warren there, being held hostage by the cafe owner. She was nuts about puzzles, and she wouldn't let them go until they had attempted to solve all of them. One was a four-piece wooden puzzle that was supposed to make a capital letter "T." It was surprisingly difficult, and none of us could solve it without help.

In Ordway we went to a diner and were joined by Jerry, Jonathan, Terry and Paul. I learned over dinner that Jerry had hiked the Pacific Crest Trail TWICE! "And I'd like to do it again," he said. I was in awe. He patiently answered my barrage of questions about the experience.

The rest of the group was staying at a hotel, but I had talked Mike into camping the town park. That would turn out to be the worst decision EVER. Sorry, Mike.

(Warning: TMI here) After dinner I had started to feel nauseous, so when we got to the park I immediately set up my tent and crawled in to assume the fetal position. After a few hours rolling around in misery I ejected everything I had eaten that day. I guess the gas station diet had finally caught up with me. And that was only the beginning of the night from hell. 

Though the nausea subsided, I couldn't get to sleep due to x   a noisy pickup basketball game nearby. After what seemed like an eternity, the game finally ended, but then two teenage girls stuck around to gossip noisily for another hour. It was getting late - didn't these kids have a curfew?! 

Finally they left, and we had the park to ourselves. Just as I was drifting off, I heard a sprinkler in the distance and Mike tossing around. "Jess?" he eventually called out. "I think the sprinklers are turning on in a line... and they're going to work their way toward us." My body was in denial, but I saw the necessity of moving our tents, so I begrudgingly crawled out of my warm sleeping bag to take care of it. 

Mike moved his tent under a pavilion, but I didn't want to be on concrete, because I knew my rainfly would whip around in the wind and keep me awake if I didn't stake it down. So I picked a spot near the pavilion on a patch of dirt. Surely the sprinklers wouldn't reach me there. I bet you can guess where this is going...

As I was drifting off yet again, I suddenly felt something pop up under my back. I cried out in despair at my idiocy - My tent was right on top of a friggin' sprinkler head! I scrambled out and took everything out of the tent, trying not to get completely soaked in the process but failing miserably. I dragged my stuff up to the pavilion and plopped down on the ground, almost in tears. 

It was nearly 4 am by this point, but the hiss of the sprinklers and the incessant chatter of an early bird were determined not to let me get a wink of sleep. After tossing around in my wet sleeping bag for a while, I gave up entirely and got my ipad out to read a book. When I found myself reading the same sentence over and over without comprehension, I switched over to mindlessly browsing facebook for a while... which is generally a bad idea, especially when you're that tired. I put the offensive device away and lay there in a catatonic state until the sun came up.
