#### “Celebrate endings, for they precede new beginnings.” ~Jonathan Lockwood Huie

Setting out on the trip I thought the absence of distraction would be good for me. It would make me a captive audience for my thoughts. Maybe I'd finally confront my demons and work through the existential angst that lurks under the surface of my busy life. But hundreds of hours on a bike didn't necessarily result in the deep self-reflection I had expected. 

Far away from real-world pressures with nothing to do but pedal along and observe the scrolling landscape, it's surprising how quickly your thoughts become primitive. ("Ugh, this friggin hill... Push, push, push... So hungry... I think I might have enough peanut butter left to make a sandwich... No, I can wait... Just 12 miles to the next town... Ooh, pretty birds...") Occasionally I'd have a burst of insight about how some aspect of bike touring is a metaphor for life in general, but more often I was just trying to get the Oscar Meyer weiner song out of my head.

So, maybe all that mental downtime was meditative, and maybe it was worthwhile as a way to clear my head. It was a chance to slow down, live in the moment, and just be. But after several months of this I found myself itching for more intellectual stimulation. I had grown bored with the same thoughts that looped through my head. I craved more inputs, more fodder for my brain. 


#### Since I've been back...

It's been a whole month since I crossed the Golden Gate Bridge on my bike. I got back during the last week of August which has given me a month to hang around and plug back into Bay Area life before Hackbright starts on Sept 29th. I really lucked out that my friend, Fiona, offered me a place to satay. She had just moved to a studio in San Francisco, so she let me sublet her old place in Oakland for the remaining month and a half of her lease. Win, win!

Finding a reasonable place to live in San Francisco, the tightest and most expensive rental market in the country, turned out to be a month-long battle. I sent nearly a hundred emails and visited more than twenty apartments before I finally secured a sublease in the Mission. There were many moments when I felt like I would *never* find a place to live. I questioned why I wanted to live in a city that didn't seem to want me back. Fortunately I have lots of amazing, supportive friends who kept my spirits up and reminded me that even in my worst-case scenario I wouldn't end up homeless.

A few weeks ago, in the midst of the housing search, my bike got stolen out of our locked backyard in Oakland. Yes, my touring bike. The one I rode across the country. My anger with myself for naively thinking it would be safe outside and my rage toward the thief are still fresh, so that's all I'm going to say about that.

During this time I've also been doing the preparatory work for Hackbright. I'm working through the exercises in the book, How to Think Like a Computer Scienctist, and it feels so, so good to program again. I was worried I would've forgotten everything about Python after several months off the computer, but it didn't take long for it to come back. 

This weekend Hackbright is hosting a two-day beginner-friendly hardware hackathon. I formed a team with some other girls in my Hackbright cohort, and we've been brainstorming project ideas via email. I'm a little nervous because I've never worked with hardware before, but I'm excited to learn and make something cool as part of a team. Learning is easiest when it's driven by curiosity and a sense of play, so I can't think of a better way to get into that frame of mind before Hackbright. 

Right after I wrote that I got an email with an awesome, relevant quote from a Dev Bootcamp participant: "The secret ingredient is playful curiosity...If you're just here for the job, it might be hard to lean in to that playful curiosity, but if you're actually excited to express yourself in software, about learning this new vocabulary, this new skill, then it's not so hard to stay playfully curious."

### Seek balance over your years, not your days. 

That's a line from a lifehacking blog post I read a long time ago that stuck with me. The message of the post was that a lot of time we squander our energy chasing after all the things we *want* to do. We try to cram a little bit of everything into our days, but each task switch claims time and dilutes our efforts. When you try to dabble in everything at once, it's nearly impossible to achieve true mastery in any one area. I think it's ideal to hone in just one or two main pursuits you really care about then commit to pouring yourself into it for a period of time, even if it means neglecting other things.

That's why I am so grateful to have this opportunity to single-mindedly focus on learning to code and build amazing websites. It'll be intense. I'm sure there will be many moments of frustration and crises of self doubt. But just like biking across a continent, transforming an awesome web developer happens one hill, one challenge, one day at a time. You just have to stick with it.

#### Life is change

My grandmother, the daughter of a military chaplain who moved around constantly throughout her childhood, often quotes this advice from her father: "Life is constant change." The older I get the more I realize how true that is. In the last six years I've gone from high school to college to studying abroad to the working world to the bike trip and now back to school to train for an entirely new industry. 

Major life transitions can be disorienting and stressful. Each time it shakes up your sense of identity a bit as you learn to navigate your new environment. But then slowly, surely, finally, and inevitably the dust will settle and you will find your new equilibrium. I'm learning to trust in that process.
