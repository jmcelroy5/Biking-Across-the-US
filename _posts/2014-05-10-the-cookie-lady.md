excerpt: "The Cookie Lady, whose real name was June Curry, is legendary on the TransAmerican Trail. Since 1976, the year of the inaugural Bikecentennial ride, she offered cookies and hospitality to cyclists in her home in a remote town just before the Appalachians. She passed away a few years ago, but her guest house (the Bike House) is kept open for cyclists to stay overnight. I called the day before I was planning to pass through town to make sure there was space was available. The lady I spoke to said the back door would be unlocked and to just let myself in."

The Cookie Lady, whose real name was June Curry, is legendary on the TransAmerican Trail. Since 1976, the year of the inaugural Bikecentennial ride, she offered cookies and hospitality to cyclists in her home in a remote town just before the Appalachians. She passed away a few years ago, but her guest house (the Bike House) is kept open for cyclists to stay overnight. I called the day before I was planning to pass through town to make sure there was space was available. The lady I spoke to said the back door would be unlocked and to just let myself in. 

Th Bike House has essentially become a shrine to the Cookie Lady's memory and a museum of TransAmerican cyclist memorabilia. The walls are completely covered in postcards, letters, pictures, newspaper clippings, clothes, and bike gear left behind by the many thousands of cyclists that have passed through. The kitchen is still kept stocked with store-bought cookies, ramen, oatmeal, coffee, and snacks. When I got there I heated up some soup I brought and cracked open a beer someone had left behind. Then I spent a long time just reading the walls. Here are of the my favorite notes I saw: 

There will come a time in every man's life where he must sacrifice what he is for what he is to become. The time for us was no yesterday, nor is it tomorrow, with this mountain and this country, OUR country, ahead of us, that time is NOW.

They said I was a fool to waste my time searching my mind, but the more I find, the more I find the time to search."

I called my friend, Jay, who did the same bike trip in 2009 and had actually met the Cookie Lady. She liked to take pictures of every cyclist who passed through with a Polaroid camera, and he remembers her lamenting how hard it had become to find Polaroid film. He said he left behind a biking glove, but I couldn't find it among the sheer amount of stuff that was there.

As night fell, I started to become keenly aware of how alone I was there. The house that was so friendly in the daylight suddenly felt spooky. As I lay in my sleeping bag on a musty couch in the dark, every creak was amplified in the silence. At one point I heard tapping on the window that grew louder and faster until the whole window was rattling. Then I heard the train horn and realized with relief that the house sat right next to the train tracks. 

Needless to say, it was not the most restful night. But I am still really glad I got to stay there so I could be a part of the TransAmerican Trail tradition. I signed the guestbook and left my mark on the house with a "Viva la bici" sticker from the East Bay Bicycle Coalition and a bicycle-themed card my mom gave me when I left that said, "Wind in your hair, sun on your face, in a good place."

Though she didn't even ride a bike herself, June Curry loved the TransAm cyclists, and she continued her hospitality even as her health declined in her last years. I think it's so cool that she found her way to brighten others' lives, and in doing so she brought the world to her doorstep
