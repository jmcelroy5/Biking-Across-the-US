I tackled a portion of the Blue Ridge Parkway, a chain of mountains that makes for one of the most scenic drives in the US and one of the most grueling days on the TransAmerican Trail. Up until that point the ride had been gentle with nothing but flat stretches and rolling country hills, but all the while I felt the Appalachians looming ahead."

Last Thursday was my first really tough ride. I tackled a portion of the Blue Ridge Parkway, a chain of mountains that makes for one of the most scenic drives in the US and one of the most grueling days on the TransAmerican Trail. Up until that point the ride had been nothing but flat stretches interspersed with rolling country hills, but all the while I felt the Appalachians looming ahead of me. I had been looking forward to this explosion in the route elevation chart with both excitement and dread (traveling right to left):

I spent the entire morning crawling up impossibly long ascents. It was exhausting, and after a few hours of climbing all I could do was laugh at the road that rose endlessly upward. At each bend in the road I kept hoping for a reprieve around the corner, but more often than not there was just more climbing. At least I had great weather for it, 80 degrees and sunny, perfect for enjoying the views of the Shenandoah Valley below.

Once you finally get past the Parkway, it almost feels like all of your hard work was for naught, because you lose your whole day's worth of elevation gain over one brief and harrowing descent into an eerie railroad town called Vesuvius. The downhill is so steep it's not even enjoyable. My hands hurt from clenching the brakes, and at each hairpin turn I worried I'd lose control.

After Vesuvius I had the thought to check warmshowers for a host for the night. There was one in Lexington, a town another 30 miles away. I called her and left a voicemail but wasn't too hopeful that I'd hear back. I stopped off at an RV Park where they had campsites, but I got kind of a weird vibe there, and it didn't help that I could also hear guns from a shooting range nearby. It was only 4:00, so I decided to push on toward Lexington, though I still didn't know where I'd sleep that night.

Just as I was approaching Lexington, I got a call from the WarmShowers host, Rebecca Taylor. She invited me to stay on her farm, which was on the far side of town and only a couple miles off the route, and said that I was welcome to join them for a dinner of Brazilian hot dogs. I couldn't believe my luck!

Arriving at the Taylors' farm, overheated and exhausted, was like stepping into a dream. Rebecca showed me to the guest bedroom, and then I went to sit the front porch with her and her husband, Lee, where she handed me a glass of ice water with lemon. They said they were going to a modern dance performance in town on the Washington & Lee campus that evening and invited me to join. After a glorious shower and a delicious dinner, we all hopped in Lee's convertible to head into town.

The show was amazing. The dancers had come from the New York City Ballet and several other big city dance companies for this festival in Lexington. Sitting there, mesmerized by the dancers, I laughed to myself what an unexpected turn my day had taken. We went to a party after the show where they had food trucks, beer from local breweries, and a couple of bands playing. 

The Taylors were a fascinating couple. I was inspired by how they so regularly and warmly welcome travelers into their home and lives. They had several Brazilian exchange students when their children were younger, and their guestbook was brimming with TransAmerican cyclists they had hosted over the years.

When their four children were younger, they bought an RV and took off on a year-long tour around the country to see new places and decide where they wanted to settle. Rebecca is a teacher, so she enjoyed homeschooling her kids during that year on the road. 

They wound up in Lexington, VA, and it's not hard to see why. With two universities there, it has all the benefits of a college town, such as a thriving arts scene and famous speakers, but its also calm with a small-town feel. They bought the farm right outside of town 11 years ago and have lived there happily since then.

In the morning (after an incredible breakfast of bacon, cheesy grits, and coffee) Rebecca showed me their pigs, horses, and donkey and then took me out to see Lee's pottery studio, which was in a beautiful old log cabin behind their house. Lee works as a lawyer but his passion is pottery. His craftsmanship was truly incredible. There were mugs, vases, plates, and bowls, and each piece was unique. Everything set up on display, because the following weekend the studio was going to be a stop on a major two-day art tour in the county.

I had thought that looking for a host in Lexington was a shot in the dark, but little did I know I would end up with hosts that have become a regular stopover for cyclists, almost as much a fixture of the trail as the Cookie Lady! They are TransAmerican trail angels, and I will always consider my time with them as a highlight of my trip
