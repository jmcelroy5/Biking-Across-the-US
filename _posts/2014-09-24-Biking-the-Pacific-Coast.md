excerpt: "The two-week ride down the Pacific coast felt very distinct from the three months I had spent biking across the country. There was so much built-up anticipation about reaching the coast that I hadn't given much thought to the 800-mile ride from Oregon to San Francisco. For some reason I just figured it would be a breeze, as if traveling due south on the map somehow corresponded with going downhill. Hah. How very wrong I was. The coast was some of the toughest riding of the *entire* trip. Hill after hill after punishing hill. Hills that might as well have been mountains. Lots of traffic, too. But the striking ocean views usually made the unpleasantness feel worth it."

The two-week ride down the Pacific coast felt very distinct from the three months I had spent biking across the country. There was so much built-up anticipation about reaching the coast that I hadn't given much thought to the 800-mile ride from Oregon to San Francisco. For some reason I just figured it would be a breeze, as if traveling due south on the map somehow corresponded with going downhill. Hah. How very wrong I was.

But the striking ocean views usually made the unpleasantness feel worth it.

I hadn't planned out the coastal route, exept to follow Hwy 101 and 1. Luckily my friend, Adam, had thought to give me his Adventure Cycling maps for the Pacific Coast when we passed each other in Idaho going opposite ways. It turned out Hwy 101 could get really hairy, so the maps were good at getting you off the highway and sending you down parallel backroads whenever possible. It was always nice to get a break from the roar of traffic on the 101. 

One great thing about the coast is the frequency of campgrounds with $5-8 hiker/biker sites. You could count on at least one every 50-60 miles, a comfortable day's ride away. I was really impressed with the Oregon and California state parks. Almost all of the campgrounds had free or coin-operated indoor showers (an incredible luxury), and each state park was a beautiful, vacation-worthy destination in itself. My favorite one was Cape Lookout in central Oregon where our campsite was tucked away in a lush, mossy hemlock forest but only a stone's throw from a pristine sandy beach. A welcome sign for a nearby town had the fitting tagline "where the forest meets the ocean."

We stayed at campgrounds almost every night on the coast, but were also a few memorable nights at non-campgrounds. One evening we were walking our bikes up a steep hill, because my shifter cable had snapped earlier that day leaving my bike stuck in high gear and making it impossible to handle the more vicious hills. I was despairing about the fifteen remaining miles to the campground when, lo and behold, a kind stranger in an SUV stopped for us. Her name was Linda, and she offered us a guest room at her house just up the hill.

Linda was a fascinating host. Her home was a complex of quirky craftsman-style buildings tucked away down a private road. She said they were all built by a hippie intellectual couple who thought to create their own peaceful survivalist commune down... until they got divorced. She lived there happily with her husband and four dogs. She showed us around her garden and picked veggies for our dinner then invited us inside, where she surprised us by performing a song on the electric harp in her living room.

Hearing that Linda had once worked as a massage therapist, Jeremiah mentioned to her that I had developed achilles tendonitis. Strangely it hadn't bothered me over the whole trip but just recently flared up. Without hesitation, Linda offered me a heel massage to loosen up the tendons so they would heal faster. The next day the difference was noticeable, and within two more days the pain was gone.

The next night was another interesting one. We weren't able to make it to a campground, so we resolved to stealth camp. Around dusk, our prospects were looking grim. Houses and private property lined the country road we were on. There seemed to be no good hiding places, until we happened upon a driveway blocked with a row of large stones. 

We dumped our bikes at the base and walked up the steep gravel drive to find the most perfectly flat, empty lot. We were so high above road level, no one driving by would think to look up at us.

#### Plenty of Company

The coast is an extremely popular bike route, so we were meeting more bike tourists than ever. The hiker/biker campsites were full of cyclists on tours of varying durations. The majority were men, who fell into two distinct categories: 1) young vagabonds presumably putting off real-world responsibility, and 2) the older, more seasoned cyclists, in many cases recently retired. We also saw plenty of MAMILs (middle aged men in lycra) out for day rides on carbon-fiber speed machines. No solo women, sadly, though I did meet a few couples. 

After a few days Jeremiah and I joined up with Victor, a Spanish fellow from Barcelona who was biking from Canada to Mexico. It seemed too funny and ironic that after helping Jeremiah practice his Spanish for so long, we'd pick up a travel companion who was a native speaker. 

We never tired of barraging Victor with questions about his life in Spain. We got him to tell us about Occupy protests in Barcelona, his previous job designing the scenery at a theme park, and a house in the countryside he had just finished building all on his own. His food choices brought back memories of my time in Spain - His typical meal consisted of baguette slices rubbed down with tomato, topped with cold cuts of ham, and then drizzled in olive oil.

We caught up with Brady and Ryan in Eureka, CA, where they had been staying with Ryan's sister's friend for a few days enjoying the greenery that Humboldt County is so well known for. The guys were really happy to be reunited again. They'd been separated when they crossed both the Oregon and California state lines, so they were determined to at least cross the Golden Gate Bridge together at the end.

Later that day we ran into another group of cyclists, who we'd met at hiker/biker sites before. Our group continued to grow until we were a caravan of nearly ten people that stuck together for several days.

#### Ferndale, California 

One of the most memorable nights was spent a cow pasture at the Humboldt County Fairgrounds in Ferndale, CA. We had the luck of arriving during the annual county fair, which, after thousands of miles biking across the country, was the most stereotypically American thing I had witnessed. The county fair was complete with vomit-inspiring carnival rides, foot-long corn dogs, funnel cake, games with giant stuffed animals for prizes, and a real RODEO!

We joined the rowdy crowds at the rodeo and cheered for the cowboys. One of the bull riders was the star football player at the local high school who was apparently trying it for the first time. It made us wonder if maybe biking skills might be transferrable to riding an angry bull... but decided we wouldn't bet our lives on it.

The following morning we biked through tree-lined neighborhods of perfectly-maintained Victorian houses and went for breakfast at a diner on Ferndale's quaint Main Street. Entering the diner was like walking onto a movie set. Retired farmers in cowboy hats huddled around tables playing card games, while friendly waitresses bustled around serving hearty breakfasts and re-filling coffee cups.

#### Avenue of the Giants

Another highlight of the ride down the coast was Avenue of the Giants, 30 miles of blissful riding down a perfectly paved, mostly flat road with awe-inspiring redwoods rising overhead. We were riding parallel to 101 but far enough away that the road got very little traffic. It was so quiet and peaceful we could hear nothing but the redwood branches creaking in the wind.

#### The Longest Ride

With the enormous task of crossing the country behind me and closing in on my final destination, I was in a much different frame of mind all the way down the coast. The novelty of the bike tour had worn off, and I was starting to feel the pull of familiar faces and responsibilities back home. My mind was ahead of me in San Francisco, but my body still had to bike hundreds of miles of difficult terrain.

Within 200 miles of San Francisco, I was yearning to cross the Golden Gate. So I woke up early one morning and cranked out 112 miles in one day. Though I felt a little guilty leaving my riding group behind, it felt right to finish my trip in solitude. The long ride was intense and empowering. Then the next day it was just 80 more miles to San Francisco.
