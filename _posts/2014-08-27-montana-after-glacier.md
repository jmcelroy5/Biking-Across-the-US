excerpt: "I had to figure out my own route from Glacier back to where I had broken off from the TransAm in Missoula. It went pretty well, except for one notably treacherous 20-mile stretch on a narrow road with no shoulder. The road itself wasn't so different from the country roads I usually ride on, but once I had gotten a few miles in, there was steady traffic coming both ways. Cars rushed by me too close and too fast. Finally I made it to an intersection where I would turn onto a road with a wider shoulder. I saw a gas station on the corner and pulled into the parking lot to decompress. While I was eating ice cream, a trucker who had passed me on the road came up and scolded me, saying I 'shouldn't be riding on that road where there's no bike lane.' As if there's ever a bike lane."

#### West Glacier to Swan Lake (55 mi)

I had to figure out my own route from Glacier back to where I had broken off from the TransAm in Missoula. It went pretty well, except for one notably treacherous 20-mile stretch on a narrow road with no shoulder. The road itself wasn't so different from the country roads I usually ride on, but once I had gotten a few miles in, there was steady traffic coming both ways. Cars rushed by me too close and too fast. Finally I made it to an intersection where I would turn onto a road with a wider shoulder. I saw a gas station on the corner and pulled into the parking lot to decompress. While I was eating ice cream, a trucker who had passed me on the road came up and scolded me, saying I "shouldn't be riding on that road where there's no bike lane." As if there's ever a bike lane.  

I stopped at a USFS campground on Swan Lake for the night and snagged the last available campsite. It was really spacious for me and my one little tent, so I felt a little guilty seeing cars circling the campground searching in vain for a site. At one point I saw a touring cyclist go right by. "He'll be back," I thought. And sure enough, he circled back around and asked to share my site, which I was more than happy to do. His name was Ryan, he was about my age, and he had an awesome touring setup with sunflower seed buckets for panniers. 

Ryan said he was traveling with two childhood friends, but they had gotten separated earlier in the day and didn't have cell service to reconnect. Their trip had started a month before in Wisconsin. They had also just been in Glacier, and now they were making their way to the coast before heading down to San Francisco. Eventually two more cyclists showed up to the campsite, one with round green buckets for panniers and the other with a bob trailer. They looked irritated. 

"We waited for you for hours in the last town! Didn't you get our text?!" they said to Ryan. When they noticed me sitting at the picnic table their expressions softened. They introduced themselves as Jeremiah and Brady, Ryan's childhood best friends and bike trip compadres. The three guys were great company, and we stayed up well past dark chatting around the campfire.

#### Swan Lake to Clearwater Fishing Access (70 mi)

The next morning I was ready a little earlier than the others, so I took off, eager to crank out the miles. I was in the zone all day, listening to an audiobook and taking few breaks. I expected the guys would catch up with me at some point, but they never did.

That evening I arrived at the fishing access area where I planned to camp, but being a Friday all the sites were full. I approached two men who seemed to have extra space on their site. Before I could even ask, they encouraged me to pitch my tent next to theirs and invited me to have dinner with them. While I set up camp, one set about whipping up a chicken stir fry while the other made me a vodka tonic. Once again, I couldn't believe my luck!

The men were two brothers on a fishing trip, and they both had daughters around my age, explaining their eagerness to help me out. While we were eating dinner a lady from one site over came to chat. She told us she was taking a vacation from her farm where she and her husband raise 20,000 turkeys at a time.

I slept peacefully with the sound of the river. When I woke up the men were packing up to go. They had left me a slice of apple pie and a nice note on my bike seat. The apple pie made an excellent breakfast.

#### Clearwater Fishing Access to Missoula (40 mi)

The next morning I had just 40 miles to go to Missoula, where I was looking forward to an afternoon of rest at Bruce's house. The ride was tougher than expected, probably because I tend to underestimate rides under 50 miles. 

When I got to Bruce's house I was surprised to see tents and bikes I recognized in the yard. It was the three boys from Wisconsin I had met at the campsite a few nights before. I wondered how the heck they got ahead of me and figured they must have ridden the 110 miles to Missoula in one day. 

I showed myself into the familiar house, took a shower, and started a load of laundry, feeling grateful for this sanctuary Bruce provides for cyclists in Missoula. When I went back outside John, one of the permanent house residents, had arrived. I hadn't spoken to John much on my previous visit, so this time I engaged him in conversation. 

It didn't take long to discover that John's number one passion is organic food and gardening. He talked to me at length about their vegetable garden in the back, a gardening club he was spearheading at the University of Montana, the community farm where he volunteers his time, and the thriving local food movement in Missoula. He said he was planning to make a veggie stir-fry for dinner and invited me to join him. It was simple and colorful and delicious. After dinner he pulled out his favorite vegetarian cookbooks for me to look through then showed me how to make homemade banana ice cream.

Later on the Wisconsin boys (Ryan, Jeremiah, and Brady) showed up. They said they hadn't made it more than 20 miles on their ride to Missoula before two of them got flat tires. A chatty lady in a pickup truck offered them a ride then insisted on taking them all the way to town. 

We lounged around outside talking while various characters drifted in an out of the scene: a couchsurfer on a road trip, a girl who was hitchhiking across the US, Bruce's energetic eight-year-old son, a lady who brought us a bowl of raspberries from the garden, and Caleb, a resident of the house who makes a living as a musician.

That evening the four of us joined up with two other bike touring guests, a couple from DC, and hit the town. We started at a restaurant called the Walking Mustache where we enjoyed live music by an impressive solo guitarist and drinks/appetizers at happy hour prices that the manager had extended past happy hour just for us. Our conversation ranged freely and deeply, and I found myself laughing more than I had in a while. 

We hit several more bars, taking turn buying pitchers of beer for the group. At one noisy, crowded bar we made some new friends, two guys who worked on a permaculture farm in Missoula and dressed in a style I can only describe as Amish chic. Jeremiah raved to them about our warmshowers host and the communal paradise his home represented. Before we knew it, the night had passed by in a blur and the whole crew, including our two new friends, were headed back to crash on Bruce's lawn. 

#### Missoula (0 miles)

For breakfast one of the guys from the permaculture farm made an impressive stir-fry for the whole group using John's organic veggies. Continuing the theme of organic gardening, John offered to take us on a tour of the community gardens in town. 

The Wisconsin guys and I piled in his car and he drove us to  FLAT, the Forum for Living with Appropriate Technology (a university co-op house that demonstrates sustainable living), and then to PEAS, a huge urban farm where we walked around sampling all kinds of delicious fruit and veggies (zucchini, snap peas, broccoli, kale, strawberries, raspberries, etc.) that tasted way better than their conventionally-grown grocery store counterparts. It was really neat talking to the workers and volunteers on the farm.

John also took us to REI so we could grab a few things we needed for our bikes. Then we stopped by to see a house where he had lived for a period of time in a large teepee in the backyard... until the teepee burned down. It turned out that the fire may have been fortuitous, though - Since his last visit a huge, dead tree had fallen right onto the site where the teepee had stood before.

After a series of additional errands in John's car we returned to Bruce's house. then went for ice cream at a shack that seemed to have a permanent line wrapping around the block.

In the evening Jeremiah and I biked down to the river that runs through the center of town in Missoula. We waded out to an island, and then Jeremiah went out to fish while I stayed on the rocky shore to read a book and watch river rapid surfers and tubers go by.

When we got back to the house Ryan had started whipping up a huge pasta dinner for everyone. I worked on my bike a little, because it was starting to need some TLC. I replaced the ripped back tire and did what I could to clean the goop off the chain and cassette.

The guys were planning to head out the next day, and I decided I would head out with them. I had been biking solo for the last several weeks, and I was happy to have some company for the next leg of the journey.
