####Canon City to Hartsel (60 something miles)

I was so nervous about this ride, my first day in the Rockies. The elevation profile showed several thousand feet of elevation gain over 30-40 miles. Texting with my friend, Jeremy, who had his own figurative mountains to climb back at home, we talked about the concept of impostor syndrome and "legitness". The rest of the day the song, "Too legit, too legit to quit" would be my anthem as I pedaled forever upward.

Fortunately the inclines turned out to be mercifully gradual, making the climbs manageable even with my reduced lung capacity in the high altitude. And it certainly helped that the scenery was absolutely stunning. I couldn't get over how beautiful it was.

I stopped for lunch in a tiny mountain town called Guffey, which I had heard was very colorful and cyclist-friendly. I stayed for a long time chatting with an older man and the bartender, who were very interested in hearing about my trip. I learned that the elected mayor of Guffey is a cat. I considered ending my trip right then and there, but the road urged me onward. 

More beautiful, scenic riding through national forestland took me to the tiny town of Hartsel. I sat down in their quaint diner for dinner and ended up getting into a conversation with my incredibly friendly waitress. Her name was Mary Ellen, and she looked to be about my age and expecting a baby. She radiated happiness, and she was a captivating storyteller. 

I knew there was a B&B in town that allowed tent camping for $25 (highway robbery if you ask me), so I asked her if there was anywhere else in town where I could pitch my tent. She said her family's ranch house was just 5 miles up the route, and I could camp there.

I was so grateful to have an invitation to camp, but by this time it was freezing and windy outside, and I wasn't looking forward to another 5 miles. Just as I kicked up my kickstand to leave, a real cowboy leaned out the front door of the diner and called out, "Are all fired up about biking or would you like a ride?" 

It turned out to be Mary Ellen's father, the pastor of the local church. He invited me back inside for a drink then chucked my bike in the back of his pickup truck. We stopped at the church on the way to their house, and he brought out a slim New Testament for me: "No one should be traveling without the word of God," he said. 

When we rolled up to their ranch he asked me, "Now, are you all fired up about camping out here in the cold, or do you want your own bed and a hot shower?" The second option, please! Their guest room was so comfortable, and I was so relieved I wouldn't have to camp in the high-altitude sub-freezing temperatures.

The pastor was a very thoughtful and intelligent person, and throughout the evening we had talked about all kinds of things. He seemed approving of my adventure and believed that young people benefit from some sort of coming-of-age journey. We got into deeper territory about trust in strangers, the role of government, and self-defense. We expressed differing views, but listening to his perspective and finding our common ground was very enlightening. 

Mary Ellen came home from the diner, and I enjoyed getting to talk to her more while her dad made us fish and vegetables for dinner. Later on her mom came home from work (she works at a prison), and we all continued chatting until late into the night.

####Hartsel to Breckenridge (30 something miles)

The next day Mary Ellen and I went back to the diner to have breakfast together. She seemed to know everyone who walked through the door, and they all loved her. I already felt like I had known her forever. We talked about our friends, love, family, and the unexpected turns that life takes. I feel certain if we lived in the same place we would become good friends.

My ride that day would went over Hoosier Pass at 11,600 feet. The climb was not only a grind but also a harrowing experience. The mountain road had no shoulder, and it was lined with gravel and sand in places. The traffic mostly consisted of semi trucks and RV campers, and since there was a steady stream going both ways, they barely budged to give me space. One truck that barreled seemingly just inches away sent me into hyperventilation mode, a real complication at that elevation. 

I finally made it up there in one piece. I had crossed the Continental Divide for the first time and conquered the highest summit on the TransAmerican Trail!

The descent was incredible. The other side of the mountain was lush and green with babbling brooks and glassy lakes. I coasted into Breckenridge with barely a pedal stroke and found myself on a bustling Main Street of a quaint mountain resort town. 

I got off my bike to walk, and less than 5 minutes later a lady stopped to ask me where I was going with all that stuff. Her jaw dropped when I told her about my trip, and she was curious where I stay at night. "Campgrounds, churches, fire stations, hostels..." I began, and without hesitation she responded, "Well, I have a house!" She invited me to stay the night and take care of her new puppy while she went to a dinner function. I couldn't believe her kindness and my luck! 

The lady, Lisa, is a remarkable person. Intense, energetic, and authentic, she leads an interesting and full life. She had worked for many years and in many countries as a tour organizer and guide for Frommer's travel company. She met her husband, a British man, on one of her tours and they had adopted two beautiful daughters who are now in their twenties. They were all out of town, so unfortunately I didn't get to meet them. She now works as an elementary school teacher, and her genuine care for her students was so apparent. 

Her home was beautiful, and I fell in love with her stunning Rhodesian Ridgeback puppy, Zola, who had the most expressive face I've ever seen on a dog. Lisa cooked a dinner of chicken over quinoa with asparagus before leaving for her event. I was in heaven for the rest of the evening reading on a comfy leather couch with the dog's head cradled in my lap.

The next day Lisa invited me to spend the day at a horse refuge ranch where she volunteers. She was taking some of her students, who were struggling in school and having to repeat the grade, for 5 Fridays in the summer to learn to care for the horses. 

The horses there were all rescued from owners who either neglected or abused them or just couldn't afford to take care of them anymore. I got to work with a yearling, who had been out in a pasture since birth with very little human interaction. I carried a sack of grain and made friends with the horse via her stomach. At first she shrank away when I got close, but after just half an hour I was petting her face, attaching a lead rope, and teaching her to follow me around the pen. Forget that web development stuff, I think I've found my calling as a horse whisperer!

By the time we got back it was late afternoon, too late to ride out. But Lisa seemed happy to host me for another night, and I was happy to play dogsitter again while she went out for another dinner event. When she got home she fired up the chimenea on her porch and whipped up a chicken salad to share.
