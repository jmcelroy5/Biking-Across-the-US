The more I think about bike travel the more it makes sense to me at this juncture in life. There are so many reasons why this feels like the right thing to do, but here are the major ones.

####1. Take time to pause and disconnect  
For most of my life I've known nothing but being a student. I've lived inside the neat lines, going from one structured experience to the next. Now I feel the need to step off the conveyor belt for a while and examine the factory from the outside, to pause and experience what it's like to just exist outside of the obligations and pressures of school and career. When you're riding a bike for eight hours a day there's a lot of time to let your mind wander. This will be a great time to ask myself the bigger picture questions so that I can re-enter the world with a stronger sense of what matters to me and who I want to be.    
    
####2. The physical and mental challenge 
_The physical:_ Training for a marathon last year taught me how to endure and to love physical challenges that require grit and determination and consistently showing up every day. In any long-term pursuit you have to love the process but you also get to celebrate when your accumulated efforts add up to a major acomplishment, like finishing a 26-mile race or biking across a continent.  

_The mental:_ I've found that when traveling you experience higher highs and lower lows than in normal life. I imagine that's even more amplified when you're a solo bike tourist. While I fully expect and look forward to moments when everything is just peachy, I also know there are going to be flat tires and headwinds and scorching heat and loneliness and bumpy roads and hills that seem like they never end. But oftentimes it's the hard parts make for the best memories, and finally, if this weren't hard it wouldn't be worth attempting. I want to embrace the challenges as opportunities to learn to rely on my own judgment and to choose my attitude in difficult circumstances.    

####3. Make lasting memories    
At my age I don't have anything that is tying me down. No house, no car, no mortgage, no children, no pets... I'm subletting a fully furnished apartment, so I don't even own furniture! It will probably take me no more than an hour to pack up all my belongings for storage. However, what I do have is a wealth of time and health.

Quitting my first job to go on this bike trip was not an easy decision. The routine is pleasant, and it's comforting in a way to have a place to go to every day. But it is a little alarming how quickly time can fly by in this manner, with all the days blending together in a blur. I'd prefer to do things now that I'll remember the rest of my life.   

I don't want to wait for "someday" that may never come. I want to go while I'm still young and crazy and before I start thinking more sensible thoughts. When I'm 40 I want to look back on these years and shake my head with a smile, saying "What was I thinking?!" When I told my aunt about this trip, she said my uncle biked around western Europe when he was my age and that hardly a week goes by even now that he doesn't mention that trip.    

####4. Exploration and discovery    
I was lucky to have many opportunities for international travel as a student, yet I've barely seen a fraction of my own country. I've sped through Texas on road trips and flown into many major cities, but I don't have a good sense of what lies in the expanses between them. I'm curious to see what the US is made of.    
    
Another valuable thing I picked up from running is how to feel at home on the road. At the point in my training when 13+ mile runs became routine, I got accustomed to being a long way from home with no transportation back but my own two legs. It enhanced my relationship with my surroundings and my neighborhood and empowered me a way I couldn't have imagined before. After living in Berkeley for over a year I have the lay of the land and know all the roads and parks and pathways far more intimately than if I never ran. Bike travel is like that but on a larger scale.    

####5. Experience the Simplicity   
On a bike tour life is essentially reduced to exercise, eating, sleeping, and navigating. After a long day of biking even the simplest of foods (a can of chili or rice and beans) taste like a four star meal. After a few days of camping out, a hot shower is heavenly. I love the feeling of self-sufficiency, when everything you need to live is right there on your bike. I've always believed on an intellectual level that less is more, but I want to experience a frugal, simple lifestyle firsthand and know in real terms how few material posessions are really needed to get by and be happy.
