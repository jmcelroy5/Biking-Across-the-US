Right now I'm sitting at the Courthouse Grill in Charles City, Virginia where I just scarfed down a BBQ pulled pork sandwich and the most refreshing beer ever. I'm typing away on my ipad, reflecting on my first day on the TransAmerica Trail and wondering how I could possibly do it justice.

#### A night in Richmond

Last night I landed at Richmond International and took a cab downtown to meet my CouchSurfing host, Kate. She works at a shop called Beads and Rocks, so I touched base with her there then set out to roam the streets until she freed up at 10:00. It happened to be First Fridays, so there was plenty going on in the streets. The hipsters of VCU give San Francisco hipsters a run for their money! 

Working at an artsy, metaphysical gem store seemed to make Kate acquainted with the characters of the neighborhood. This morning at a coffeeshop, a man she knew gave us the astrological forecast then made a date with her to read her tarot cards. 

Kate is really interested in geology and botany and said she's applying for an internship at an outdoor education camp in Santa Cruz. It would be amazing to find her on the West Coast when I get back. As I was leaving, she gave me two stones, jade and bloodstone, for protection on my ride. 

#### Getting on the Trail

I got an amazing amount of help getting started from Sharon and Robert from Red Barn Bikes, a bike shop between Richmond and Yorktown. Sharon picked me up from Kate's house and took me out to their shop (which is really in a barn!) where my fully-assembled bike and other things I had shipped to them were waiting. 

We put the bike in the car and headed for Yorktown, where the TransAm begins, stopping for lunch at a local drive-up diner on the way. I got a chicken fried steak sandwich that would be more than enough to fuel the ride ahead of me. Sharon looked over my map with me and gave me an idea of what to expect over the next several days.

At Yorktown Beach, I followed the TransAm tradition of dipping my back tires in the water and taking a picture with the Yorktown Victory Monument. Then I set off toward Williamsburg, watching eagles soar overhead and feeling vaguely patriotic. 

#### Williamsburg
 
I stopped in Williamsburg, where I saw historic buildings and people walking around in colonial garb. I ran into three women on touring bikes who had just started the TransAm today also. I also met a student at the College of William & Mary who was pedaling a stationary bike in the tourist area to raise money for her Bike and Build trip across the US, a group ride in support of affordable housing.

####  On to Charles City

The riding today was very pleasant, mostly along the Colonial Parkway, and then along the Capital Trail, where I got a break from riding with cars. Further along, the trail was still under construction, so I kept hopping between stretches of velvety fresh asphalted bike path and the two-lane highway.

My riding goal for today was Charles City (pop. 133, not really a city, sorry Charles), about 42 miles from Yorktown. Sharon had told me about the Courthouse Grill where the owners were friendly and might have some advice on where to pitch my tent in the area. Sure enough, they were super friendly. They said I could set up my tent in the restaurant's backyard and even offered to let the sherif know I would be there. 

Now I'm settled snug as a bug in my sleeping bag, listening to people in the nearby parking lot as they leave the restaurant. I'm exhausted but eager to see what day 2 will bring.
