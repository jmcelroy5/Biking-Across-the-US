####Sebree, KY to Elizabethtown, IL (70 mi)
 
Our last day in Kentucky and first evening in Illinois were quite eventful. Near the town of Marion, KY our route passed through an Amish community. Our hosts the night before had recommended that we stop at one of their grocery stores, called Hillside Grocery. 

When we got there, we saw an Amish man mowing his lawn with a horse-pulled contraption. He had the full beard and traditional clothing, and his young daughter in her bonnet sitting on his lap.

The store sold items that were discarded from regular grocery stores (bent cans, broken seals, a little past the "sell by" date, etc.) at a very deep discount. It was hard for two hungry, frugal cyclists to exercise self-restraint when candy bars were on sale for 25 cents and boxes of mac and cheese were going for 50 cents! We tried not to go too crazy, but we did have to spend some time reconfiguring our packing to make everything fit, and my panniers felt noticeably heavier when I rode off.

When we came out of the store, there was a horse and buggy parked outside. The driver had run into the store and left his wife sitting out in the buggy. She smiled and waved at us. They ended up leaving soon after we did, and when we got out on the highway they trotted along right behind us for a while, causing a buildup of cars behind them. It was nice because it cleared the road for us, and we were relieved to not be the only slow-moving traffic for once!

To get to Illinois we had to take a free, 20-minute ferry ride to cross the Ohio River. There was a long line of cars waiting, but we had no shame claiming our bike privilege. We jetted up to the front and squeezed in next to a trailer with a John Deere tractor on it.

Immediately on the other side of the river was Cave in Rock State Park, where we took a minor detour to see a really cool cave in a rock. Supposedly pirates used to hang out here and lure sailors into the cave to rob and torture them.

From there we decided to push on another hour or so to Elizabethtown, a cute little town that sits right on the river. At one intersection on our way we saw a hand-written poster that said "Blessing of the bikes." A little ways up the road we biked by a group of people sitting outside a church in lawn chairs surrounded by their motorcycles. A rough-looking but smiley man saw us coming and ran out to the side of the road with two cans of root beer in his hands. We couldn't say no to a cold root beer, so we stopped and talked to the group for a while. 

They were from the Pentecostal church, and they had gotten together for an annual event to "bless" their motorcycles for another year of riding. Before we left, the pastor in the group asked if they could pray over our bicycles. They gave us crosses to hang on our bikes then all gathered around to lay hands on them for a very heartfelt, spirited prayer. Thanks, motorcycle dudes!

We had heard that a B&B in Elizabethtown allowed cyclists to camp outside and also use their bathroom and showers for $7. After our detour to get our bikes blessed, we were racing to get there before the sun went down. We made it just in time, and the B&B owner showed us to her lovely landscaped backyard where we could pitch our tent next to the swimming pool. Tuan somehow still had energy after all the events of the day, so he drank with the B&B guests on the front porch while I set up the tent and called it an early night.

The next day we got a late start to enjoy being in the lovely landscaped backyard of the B&B. We took our time making oatmeal and coffee, and then i worked on my blog by the pool.

####Elizabethtown, IL to Carbondale, IL (80 mi)

Of the 10 states we pass through on the TransAmerican Trail, Illinois accounts for the least distance, since the route just cuts through the southern tip of the state. It ended up only taking about two and a half days of riding to get through it, and I found that to be quite enough. Southern Illinois was extraordinarily boring to ride through.The roadside scenery was bland and monotonous. When we passed through towns there were few signs of life, even though it was Memorial Day weekend. 

To make matters worse, for some reason Tuan and I had gotten the idea that Illinois was relatively flat and would provide some relief after the rolling hills of Western Kentucky. NOPE! The rolling hills actually grew even taller, and we got acquainted a new variation of them, the stairstep hill. That's when you reach what you think is the crest of a hill, only to realize it was a false summit and you only get a few yards of flat before phase 2 of the hill begins.

The ride from Elizabethtown to Carbondale was 80 miles that were mostly forgettable, and it was one of the hottest, sweatiest days yet. It did get a little better toward the end, though, when we went through a heavily forested nature preserve with calm, shady roads and a few beautiful lakes.

We had contacted a warmshowers host in Carbondale who said we could stay with her, but she wouldn't be home until after dark. That worked for us, since we had gotten a late start and probably wouldn't get into town until 8:00 pm anyway.

As we were approaching Carbondale the weather suddenly took a scary turn. We were traveling toward stormy grey clouds, and we saw lightning up ahead that looked a little too close for comfort. It had been such a long day, though, and we were only 3 miles from our host's house, so I obstinately pushed on, thinking we could beat the storm. Just as the rain was starting to fall, a pickup truck pulled over ahead of us on the side of the road. 

The lady inside hopped out and said "There's ground to sky lightning just two miles ahead. Throw your bikes in the truck!" We didn't hesitate to follow her orders. It turned out our rescuer was a severe storm spotter for the city of Carbondale, and she had been monitoring the weather all day, even though she was off-duty. She delivered us right to our host's house, where we took shelter on the patio right before the sky really fell out. Unbelievable! We were so lucky.

Our warmshowers host arrived half an hour later. Her name was Rachel, and she was awesome. Right when she got there she offered us beer and pulled out some delicious food she had leftover from a cookout. She's a soil science professor at the University of Southern Illinois, and she grew up on a farm in Illinois, so it was fascinating to talk to her about agriculture and environmental issues.

By this point I had been riding every day for over a week, and my body and mind were starting to feel weary. Rachel graciously offered for us to take a rest day at her house, which we gratefully accepted. So the next day, Memorial Day, I parked myself on her couch and didn't move all day. I just read East of Eden and pondered and drifted in and out of sleep. It was glorious. 

It was also an excellent food day. Rachel made a pot of good coffee in the morning, which was a huge treat after so many days drinking gas station coffee. For breakfast we whipped up chocolate chip pancakes and sausage, and then for dinner Rachel pulled out some pork chops to grill.Tuan made a delicious Vietnamese-style marinade and also a red cabbage salad, mushrooms, and rice with a sauce. We eat really well on the TransAm!

#### Carbondale, IL to Chester, IL (50 mi)

The next day, freshly showered and with rested legs and clean clothes, we took off riding to Chester, IL, a town right on the Missisippi River, which is known for being the birthplace of the cartoonist who created Popeye. When we got there we learned that it's also infamous for having the largest maximum security prison in Illinios, Fun!

There were two options on the TransAm map for that day's ride. We could either follow the main route through a couple of towns, which involved some pretty significant elevation change, or we could take an alternate route along the Mississippi levee, where there wouldn't be any services but the terrain would be a lot flatter. After contending with the hills for so long, choosing the levee was a no-brainer for us. 

The ride on levee was lovely. It was like a quiet one-lane country road, where we could go for miles without seeing a single car. It was the first time since Virginia's bike paths that I felt it wouldn't be unsafe to put my earbuds in. Listening to "Mighty" and "Ends of the Earth" by Lord Huron as the scenery rolled by was magical! 

When we got into town, we got sno cones from a stand and decompressed from the ride. Then we checked out the Popeye-themed statues and murals in the town park.

That night we stayed at a bunkhouse provided for cross-country cyclists by a community organization called the Fraternal Order of the Eagles, whose mission is "to help people." Sounds solid. The bunkhouse was about the size of a garden shed, but it was wonderful to have a roof over our heads, especially since it ended up storming that night. The club also gave us keys to use the showers and restrooms in their main building.

Another cyclist was there when we arrived, a man named Lewis from St. Louis who was also biking west. Besides Tuan, he was only the second westbound cyclist I'd met since Yorktown, so it was really fun to talk to him about his experiences! 

Once settled, we moseyed over to the Eagles lodge, which very conveniently had a bar/restaurant! We demolished some burgers and french fries. Tuan, ever the adventurous eater, also ordered some fried chicken livers as an appetizer. I was so hungry I ate those, too.

Ordering beers was a pretty hilarious experience. I asked what they had on tap, and the waitress said, "Coors Lite, Miller Lite, Bud Lite, Blue Moon, and Stag." Tuan asked her what kind of beer Stag was, and she responded "The regular kind..." Well, we can't complain when a pint of beer is only $2! But Tuan says he's looking forward to Colorado where the beer culture is a little more sophisticated.
