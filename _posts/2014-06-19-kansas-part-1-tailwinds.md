You may have noticed that I'm actually in Colorado right now, but my blog is only halfway through Kansas! I'm hoping and planning to catch up on blogging. So much has been happening, and I want to take the time to write and reflect on it all. Look out for Kansas part 2, coming soon.

####Pittsburg to Chanute (60 miles)

In the morning I woke up to the sound of rain on my tent. If it weren't so miserably humid in there I might never have emerged, but finally I begrudgingly stumbled out of my tent into the steady drizzle. I grunted a greeting to Mike, Tuan, and Terry who were  sitting at the picnic table, and then fired up my camp stove. I would need a lot of coffee to warm up to the idea of biking in that weather. 

Mike and Tuan were much more optimistic about Kansas than I was. They gave me a hard time for hating on it before really seeing it, but I just knew it it wouldn't compare to the wild and pastoral beauty we'd enjoyed so far. Also, I was dreading the wind. Every state has its major challenges. In Kentucky it was the dogs, in Missouri it was the steep hills, and in Kansas we knew it was going to be the wind. Out in the Great Plains a strong headwind can make pedaling feel futile.

Our ride from Pittsburg was fairly challenging with few breaks, because we were intent on making it to the next town before a big storm that was supposed to hit in the afternoon. It was the first day I felt like I consistently pushed the pace and kept a high heart rate. We had a moderate headwind as we headed west, though taking turns drafting behind each other made it more bearable. 

At one point I inhaled a big bug and had to stop riding to choke dramatically and appropriately freak out about the sensation of insect legs crawling down my throat. Tuan called me a whale for riding with my mouth open, which I felt was a fair comparison, but Mike wouldn't let him live that comment down. 

We stopped for a quick bite to eat at a gas station, where we were introduced to the magic that is the Pork and Bull. Two hamburger patties with ham in between. It was a protein explosion.

But no time to dilly dally! We had to beat the storm, so we plugged onward into the wind. Eastern Kansas is humid, and as the day went on it became hot as Hades. We guzzled through our water and sweat it right back out.

We had planned to camp at the city park in Chanute, but Mike convinced us that a motel would be a better option. The storm that night was supposed to be intense. So we checked into the King's Motel where we were greeted by this very appropriate sign:

We headed down to the local tavern for dinner. Tuan ordered fried gizzards as a not-so-appetizing appetizer, and we drank $1 Keystones while waxing philosophical about our personal reasons for biking across the country and how the meaning has changed for us now that we're actually doing it.

####Chanute to Eureka (64 miles)

The motel turned out to be a good call, because the morning brought an apocalyptic storm with lightning and hail.  It was nice that we got to spend the morning hanging out inside without feeling urged to get on the road, and by checkout time the storm had passed.

The sky cleared up beautifully, and the receding storm had blessed us with a phenomenal easterly tailwind. Once we got going we found ourselves effortlessly flying along at 15-20 mph! 

We noticed the water in the creeks was perilously high. If it had rained just another few inches we might've run into some flash flooding.

Mike parted ways with us about halfway through the ride to make a detour to Wichita, because his wife was flying down from Chicago to meet him for the weekend. 

The next part of the ride was pretty and peaceful along virtually car-free country roads. We met a Canadian Eastbound cyclist named Max, who recommended a lunch place called Lizard Lips a few miles up the road. We knew we couldn't pass that up.

Lizard Lips served up the best burgers of the trip and turned out to be a good place to talk to the locals. One elderly lady was eager to tell us about her recent trip to Southern California and bond with us over our sense of wanderlust. Another man entertained us (unwittingly) with his story about the time he found a *real* dinosaur egg in his backyard.

On our way into Eureka we saw fields dotted with grazing cows. I had never seen so many cows in one place. We had heard that the region we were in was called the Flint Hills, so named because a layer of rock under the soil makes the land unfarmable. The area's use for cattle grazing goes all the way back to the famous Texas cattle drives of the late 1800s.  

The cows were surprisingly aware of our presence. We stopped to take pictures of them, and before we knew it they were all crowding around the fence to stare. I think they could sense we had just eaten hamburgers and wanted to guilt us. They were so cute I briefly considered becoming a vegetarian.

Eureka was a nice little town. We hit the grocery store then cooked ramen and broccoli for dinner at our campsite in the town park. We got to see the end of a little league baseball game then watch little kids play chase and catch fireflies after dark. 

####Eureka to Newton (75 miles)

This day stands out as a particularly nice, easy ride. It definitely didn't feel like a 75 mile day, thanks to a lovely tailwind that pushed us along for most of it. 

The funny thing about tailwind is that if you don't pay attention to the direction the grass is blowing then you might not even notice you have one. The air just feels quiet and calm. It's a saying in cycling that there's no such thing as tailwinds, only headwinds and "I'm feeling particularly strong today!" 

We definitely appreciated our luck, though, when we passed by an Eastbound cyclist who said he had been struggling against the wind for days and seemed near his wit's end. We wanted to wish him tailwinds, buuut... no, sorry.

We stopped at a country store in Cassoday where they had an all-you-can-eat buffet. It was just as amazing as it sounds. They had homemade pizza, an elaborate salad bar, and brownies for dessert. 

After demolishing two big plates each, Tuan took a nap on the table and I cuddled the store's cat. It was so cute, but it had a drooling problem. I normally wouldn't mind a little cat drool on my leg, except that we had just seen the same cat on the porch not an hour before with a mouse tail wriggling from his mouth.
 
That night we stayed at the Newton Bike Shop, which nearly every Eastbound cyclist had raved to us about. The owners, James and Heather, are really passionate about hosting and helping TransAmerican cyclists. They had a nice hostel-like room for touring cyclists to stay for free and made us feel welcome to use the bathrooms and kitchen. I didn't use it, but they also have a "bike wash room" for giving your bike a bath.

In his pre-bike-shop life James was a music video producer and photographer who worked with a lot of big name musicians. Heather is an accountant with her own business. In addition to running a bike shop and cyclist hostel they have five kids. I don't know how they do it all and do it all so well!

Our friend, Lewis, with whom we kept crossing paths back in Missouri, was staying there that night. There was also a new fellow named Leo from France who had had a long career as a BBC radio announcer and has biked across the US before. He's keeping a very [entertaining blog](http://www.crazyguyonabike.com/doc/?doc_id=13270).

After getting settled at the bike shop, Tuan and I went over to the fire station where we were told we could use the showers, and then we made a grocery store run. The bike shop had a full kitchen, and we took full advantage of it! We made chicken over rice with broccoli, onions, and bell peppers. 

Next door there was a cozy cafe with live music, and on a Friday night it was a pretty happenin' place. Tuan and I went over and listened to a band called Commonfolk. They were so awesome we stayed until the very last song, even though I was struggling to keep my eyes open at 10:00. The rockstar life of bike tourers.
