Hello world! This is my first post. I'll be using this site to keep my friends and family updated on the progress of my bike trip, and if I manage to inform or inspire anyone else who is contemplating their own long-distance bike tour one day then all the better! I start biking on May 2nd, but I'll be blogging about my preparation before then, so check back for updates.
