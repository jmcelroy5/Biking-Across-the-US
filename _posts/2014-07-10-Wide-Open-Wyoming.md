####Walden, CO to Saratoga, WY (68 mi)

In Colorado the colors of the scenery were bright, bold, and vibrant. The sky seemed blue-er and the trees greener than anywhere else. The snow caps almost glowed on top of the dark mountains. As I neared Wyoming, though, I noticed the colors becoming more pastel-like, with soft green grass, pinkish brownish rock formations, and purple mountains in the distance. It's amazing how many distinct landscapes there are in this country.

My first day in Wyoming was one of my favorites. I gave little thought to my mileage and never felt remotely eager for the ride to end. I felt that I had finally found my "zen" as my mind began to mirror Wyoming's wide, vast, peaceful landscapes.

Early in the day there was a lot of standing water on the sides of the road and consequently a lot of bugs. I couldn't get off my bike without getting swarmed, and I definitely couldn't ride with my mouth open. My arms kept getting speckled all over with gnats. I now empathize a little more with car windshields. 

I started spotting antelopes that day. They blend in with the landscape, so sometimes I wouldn't notice I was approaching one on the until I heard a huffing noise and the sound of hooves prancing away. And they do prance. If you've never seen an antelope run, go to youtube right now. It's an adorable sight.

When I rolled into Saratoga, my destination for the night, I followed signs to the hot springs, which are free and open to the public. The people coming out looked like boiled lobsters, and easing into the hot water turned out to be a long process for me. Some of the locals said they love going there during the dead of winter when there's snow piled up on the sides and the springs are so steamy you can't even see across them. 

After using the showers at the hot springs, I continued on another mile outside of town to a campground by a lake where I was very happy to find Esther and Warren again. They said they had ridden with Lauren, the high-mileage girl, all day, and Tuan, who had caught up with them. Tuan and Lauren had continued past Saratoga to do a 120 mile day. 

We had a lovely evening chatting and cooking our dinners. Esther sketched the herons flying over the lake, and Warren shared some photography tips with me. Eventually the mosquitoes drove us into our tents, but I came out one last time to see a magnificent sunset.

####Saratoga, WY to Lamont, WY (71 miles)

You could pass right through the town of Lamont and not even notice. When I arrived at the intersection of the two roads where the town was supposed to sit, it just looked like more of the vast nothingness I had been seeing all day. Except for an abandoned cafe and one isolated house in the distance, there were no buildings to speak of.

On the TransAm map there was a phone number to call for some sort of campsite in Lamont. I had called earlier in the day in a brief period of cell phone service and spoken to a lady, who instructed me to turn off the main road and ride until I saw a sign. 

The sign she meant was handwritten on cardboard, and it said "Cyclist Campground -->" I followed it toward a mobile home in the middle of a field surrounded by a veritable scrap yard of old furniture, materials, and unfinished projects. Chickens, roosters, ducks, cats, and dogs roamed freely through the maze of junk piles.

A lady named LB with long silver hair came out to greet me. She lived there by herself and worked as a custodian in a tiny town 4 miles further down the road. Lamont was on a barren and uninhabited stretch of highway, and she had observed that cyclists would turn down her side road and go 4 miles out of their way in search of water. So a few years ago she just stuck up that sign and started offering them water and a place to stay right there.

She herself had to transport all her drinking water from the next town. When I got there she had several jugs waiting for me, and then she loaded me up on canned soup, fruit, and bread for dinner. She said she always keeps extra food on hand for cyclists. I was surprised and overwhelmed by her generosity!

LB and I sat down to talk, and she told me about the wild horses in Wyoming, which she often sees galloping over the plains near her house. She lamented that the cattle ranchers consider them a nuisance (since horses rough up and kill grass on their grazing land), prodding the state to take "population control" measures. She described how they use helicopters to herd the frightened horses into pens. She sometimes sneaks past gates and "no trespassing" signs to visit them where they're kept in captivity. 

I was planning to pitch my tent, but she gave me an even better option, offering to let me sleep in the back of her suburban instead. The seats were folded down, making plenty of space to spread out my sleeping bag and some pillows and blankets LB had given me to use. Once snuggled cozily inside I had a great vantage point for watching the sun set over the mountains and antelope wander across the plains. I appreciated my shelter even more when it began to storm. Wind shook the car, and lightning lit up the sky, while I remained safe and dry.

####Lamont, WY to Lander, WY (95 mi)

The next morning I awoke with a start when a cat jumped on the hood of the car. A much cuter wakeup call than rocks, at least.

I got started early, because I wanted to make it to the next real town 95 miles away. It was nice and relatively cool outside with very little wind, and most of the day I was losing elevation. The scenery was amazing, and I was in the zone, so despite the longer distance I made it to my destination by late afternoon.

I had barely stopped to eat all day, but I didn't realize how hungry I was until I got off my bike in Lander and could barely even process a thought in my low blood sugar stupor. I went and ordered an embarrassing amount of food at the first diner I saw. Even more embarrassing was the fact that after voraciously consuming every last bite of the double cheeseburger, an entire basket of fries, and a large milkshake, I was only comfortably full. 

Lander was an attractive, friendly town with a free campground in their town park. I found Esther, Warren, and two new cyclists there. Though the sun was still high, I was eager to excuse myself and retreat inside my tent with a new book I had just bought. Once nestled in my sleeping bag, not even Warren's jeers of "Jessica, you miserable sod!" could draw me out after that.
